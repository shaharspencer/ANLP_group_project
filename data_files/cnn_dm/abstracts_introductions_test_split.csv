0,"Everyone is watching Valencia’s 19-year-old left back Jose Luis Gaya with Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea hoping to snatch him from under Real Madrid’s nose this summer. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson takes a look at the Spain under 21 defender. Why are English clubs so keen? His buy-out clause is currently set at £13.5m. When you consider that Luke Shaw – of a similar age and potential – cost £27m it would be silly not to be interested; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the Premier League. Jose Luis Gaya (right) in action for Valencia during a La Liga match with Sevilla earlier this season . Reservations? He flies forward very much in the style of Jordi Alba and Juan Bernat. But those two left-backs who came before him at Valencia are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers – one at Barca and the other for Pep Guardiola at Bayern. There would be more defensive duties in England and he would be tested in the air. He has plenty of spring and good technique but at just 5ft 7ins it is not his strong point. Basically, you’re saying he can’t defend… . No, not at all. He is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own, or his team-mates’ mistakes. He is also tenacious in the tackle – and aggressive enough to come out on top against bigger players. And he is 19 so a coach such as Mourinho would be able to improve him defensively. But what is indisputable is that his natural inclination is to attack. Gaya is an attack-minded left-back who likes to get forward at every opportunity . And he is very effective going forward? Much like the aforementioned Bernat and Alba, and Liverpool’s Alberto Moreno, he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full-back. He’s not just an overlapper, he’s very good off of both feet and can make runs inside to play through-balls or shoot. He also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11-year-old whose idol was David Villa, he scored 60 goals one season in Valencia’s academy. Spain already seem to be well-stocked at left-back so will he make it to the senior first team? He has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time Juan Bernat has moved up an age category, stepping into his place. He is currently first choice for the Under-21s. Of course at senior level everyone stops moving up and as good as he is it will be hard for him to shift Alba and Bernat ahead of France 2016. Gaya slides in on Atletico Madrid midfielder Arda Turan during last month's match in Madrid . Does he want to leave Valencia? He has supported the club all his life. Hour-long trips from his home in Alicante to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that £13m buy-out clause. If the offer is right and from the right club then he is ambitious and he will go. Will he come to England? Valencia would rather do business with an English club than Real Madrid. But if the buy-out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes. He’s 20 in May and staying in Spain will be appealing. At Madrid he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the East coast. He will want some guarantees at Madrid however. Marcelo is first choice at the moment so how many games will he actually play? A club like Arsenal could come in and promise far more first-team football which might sway him but Madrid are favourites. Gaya, pictured here at the 2013 Under 20 World Cup, has represented Spain up to under 21 standard . Gaya (left) talks to team-mate Federico Vico during an under 19 international against Germany . Real Madrid bought Danillo this week and now they want Gaya. And they already have Dani Carvajal and Mareclo. Are they building a team of full-backs? Reserve full-backs Alvaro Arbeloa and Fabio Coentrao have been identified as two of the weaknesses of the squad. They want Danillo and Carvajal contesting the right back position next season, and Gaya and Marcelo the left-back spot. Coentrao and Arebeloa will both be sold in the summer. There is also a Fifa investigation into their signing of under-age youngsters currently ongoing. With a potential transfer ban hanging over them they want to cover every gap in their squad.","Gaya has been linked with a number of big clubs in Spain and England .

1,"Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola blamed his team's Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat by Porto on injuries. Porto take a two-goal advantage to Munich next Tuesday for the return leg of the last-eight clash after punishing a sloppy Bayern with two early goals from Ricardo Quaresma and a second-half effort from Jackson Martinez. Guardiola said: 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries ... their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Pep Guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad . Porto manager Julen Lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals, but they will need to be 'perfect' in the second leg. 'Now we have produced a situation for ourselves where we can dream, knowing that we will need to give everything we have got to get through,' Lopetegui, a former Barcelona team mate of Guardiola, told reporters. 'We will need to produce a perfect performance in Germany next week to progress.' Julen Lopetegui says reaching the Champions League semi-final would be a dream come true . Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch . Lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer Martinez, who had been out since early March with a hamstring problem, was one of the reasons for Wednesday's victory. 'With him back in the attack, we were able to press Bayern with some force and give them real problems,' he said. Martinez, who capitalised on an error by Jerome Boateng in the 65th minute to round Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer for Porto's third goal after Thiago Alcantara had reduced the arrears, said he was not yet 100 percent fit. The striker was a constant menace for Bayern's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed Xabi Alonso before being brought down by Neuer for a penalty that Quaresma converted. Jackson Martinez (right) rounds Neuer to slot home Porto's third goal and put them in control . Martinez troubled Bayern throughout and tackled Xabi Alonso (right) in the build up to the penalty . It was a similar story for Porto's second goal when Quaresma picked the pocket of Dante before beating Neuer with a clever finish on 10 minutes. 'It was fundamental that we tried our best to impose ourselves on Bayern and not give them a chance to settle,' Martinez said. Quaresma also sought to heap praise on Porto's team ethic, saying hard work had proved the difference between the two teams. 'There are no stars here. We all work hard for our results,' the forward said. 'The win is more important to us than the display. We have all worked extremely hard to get this win to give ourselves something to defend in the second leg.' Quaresma scores Porto's second inside 11 minutes as they took advantage of a depleted Bayern Munich .","Pep Guardiola blamed injuries for his side's disappointing defeat to Porto .

3,"Children's soft toys act as a reservoir for bacteria and bring germs into hospitals, scientists have warned. A team of researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee explored how best to minimise the risk of infection after surgery. They note that despite hand washing and other protocols, surgical-site infections continue to pose a problem. Children's toys could act as a reservoir for bacteria and bring germs into hospitals, scientists at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, have warned . The researchers concluded this implied one of two scenarios. Firstly, that current infection prevention methods are not effective. And secondly that there are alternative sources of bacterial exposure to the surgical wound. Their study revealed that soft toys brought into the operating theatre by children served as a breeding ground for bacteria. They urged parents to be aware of the dangers comfort items could pose, and take steps to eradicate the risk. Dr Jonathan Schoenecker and his team aimed to investigate if cuddly toys contribute to surgical-site infections. They swabbed stuffed animals that were brought into hospital by children ahead of surgery. The findings revealed that all those soft toys swabbed showed bacterial growth. In addition, the researchers demonstrated that a single wash and dry cycle at home, followed by sealing the toy in a plastic bag for 24 hours, effectively 'sterilised' 79 per cent of those soft toys tested. Researchers urged parents to wash and sterilise their child's toys before bringing them into the operating theatre, to help minimise the risk of their child suffering a surgical-site infection . The study report states: 'These results indicate that items of comfort, such as stuffed animals, brought into the operating room with a benevolent purpose may represent a reservoir of bacteria that could lead to unwanted surgical-site infections. 'Washing an item of comfort one day before surgery effectively sterilises that item.' The researchers note that future studies will be needed to determine the correlation between stuffed animals that test positive for bacteria and surgical-site infections. Another area to look at is whether giving a child a 'sterile' soft toy reduces the risk of surgical-site infections.","Scientists at Vanderbilt University explored how to reduce infection risk .

4,"Paypal said that the devices (stock image pictured) would be powered by stomach acid and include mini computers . PayPal is developing a new generation of edible passwords which stay lodged in your stomach to let you log in. Jonathan Leblanc, the company’s top developer, said that the devices would be powered by stomach acid and include mini computers. He said that technology had become so advanced that it allowed ‘true integration with the human body’. The next wave of passwords will be edible, ingestible or injectable and will remove the need for what he called ‘antiquated’ ways of confirming your identity, such as fingerprint scanning. Typing in a password will become a thing of the past too, he added. Mr Leblanc, the Global Head of Developer Evangelism at PayPal, said in a presentation called ‘Kill All Passwords’ that he wants to ‘put users in charge of their own security’. He said that passwords as they are now were not working and that users need to ‘harden it with something physical behind it’. Edible capsules could check the person’s glucose levels or blood pressure before beaming out encrypted data, the Wall Street Journal reported. Other possibilities include silicon chips which are put under the skin and ‘wearable computer tattoos’ which send information via a wireless connection. A diagram of a chip used in his presentation shows a device that has sensors, a wireless transmitter, photo detectors, a power coil and a temperature sensor. Mr Leblanc said PayPal was currently carrying out hackathons to develop vein recognition technologies and heartbeat recognition bands to go round a person’s wrist. But he cautioned that the company has no immediate plans to use such devices. Jonathan Leblanc, the company’s top developer, said that passwords as they are now were not working and that users need to ‘harden it with something physical behind it’ instead of typing it into a given computer field . Mr Leblanc said: ‘I can’t speculate as to what PayPal will do in the future, but we’re looking at new techniques – we do have fingerprint scanning that is being worked on right now – so we’re definitely looking at the identity field’. In a statement PayPal later said that Leblanc's comments were meant as blue skies thinking and that the company was not actually developing edible passwords. A spokeswoman said: 'We have no plans to develop injectable or edible verification systems. 'It's clear that passwords as we know them will evolve and we aim to be at the forefront of those developments. We were a founding member of the FIDO alliance, and the first to implement fingerprint payments with Samsung. 'New PayPal-driven innovations such as one touch payments make it even easier to remove the friction from shopping. We’re always innovating to make life easier and payments safer for our customers no matter what device or operating system they are using.' Edible passwords would be the latest breakthrough in biometrics after it emerged that a new app lets you use your face to log in to a website instead of using a password. True Key takes a photo of your face with the computer’s camera and stores it for later use. When you want to use a password-protected website such as your email, the app scans your face and matches it with its records - removing the need for a password. Security experts have long bemoaned how easy it is to break passwords, not least because one of the most popular is the word ‘password’. The most widely used in 2014 was '123456' followed by ‘password’ and '12345678', according to one survey. Another problem is that the average person has to remember 19 passwords but one in three said they struggled to remember them all.","Company developing a  password that stays lodged in your stomach .

7,"The hunt for missing flight MH370 will be extended, with government officials from Australia, China and Malaysia deciding to double the search area. The airplane, which spectacularly vanished last year with 239 people on board, is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast. By expanding the search area for the downed plane, the mission to recover it could go on for another 12 months, according to government officials. Scroll down for video . Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on-board . The expanded search will 'cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis', Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss. He made the announcement after meeting with Malaysian transport minister Liow Tiong Lai and Chinese transport minister Yang Chuantang on Thursday. 'We're confident we're searching in the right area,' Mr Truss told a press conference. 'I'm very confident that we have the best search equipment in the world and if the aircraft is in the area that we're looking, we will find it. 'The high resolution of the pictures that the ministers have been shown today gives us a high level of confidence that, if there is any piece of the aircraft that's within the range of these vehicles, they will pick it up and be able to identify it.' Mr Truss added all those involved in the search were determined to do everything possible 'to give answers to the families of the loves ones who've been lost'. The news came weeks after fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives reignited reports the plane could have crashed more than 5,000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (L), Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai (C) and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantan (R) shake hands after the MH370 joint press conference at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur . Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year. They believed they had identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, according to the Weekend Australian. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low,' Ahmed Shiyaam said. Mr Truss added that all those involved in the search were determined to do everything possible 'to give answers to the families of the loves ones who've been lost' The search zone for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will be doubled if nothing is found in the huge undersea area now being scanned for wreckage . Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . 'I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane.' Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing,' Mr Ibrahim said. The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The expanded search will 'cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis', Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss . 'I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, 'I saw this strange plane'. 'This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here.' Acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. A detailed map of the search was released by the Australian government . Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Curtin University Centre for Marine Science and Technology's Dr Alec Duncan began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident . Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. The crash was officially declared an accident by Malaysia civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman earlier this year. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' Mr Rahman said. It is more than one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events since the plane disappeared. 2014 . March 8 . The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 takes off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time bound for Beijing, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. The plane is last seen on military radar at 2.14am, heading west over the Strait of Malacca. Half an hour later the airline reveals to the public that it has lost contact with the plane. The plane was due to land at around 6.30am. March 10 . Vietnamese aircraft search for a plane door spotted in their waters but find nothing. A day later the hunt is widened to cover a 115-nautical mile radius involving 34 aircraft and 40 ships from several countries. March 13 . Malaysian authorities expand their search for the missing jet into the Andaman Sea and beyond after acknowledging it could have flown for several more hours after its last contact with the ground. March 15 . Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak says the missing airliner was deliberately diverted and continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with the ground. March 8 to April 24 . The search area covers the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, the Andaman Sea and the southern Indian Ocean. April 24 . The search and rescue phase becomes a search and recovery phase, with it moving a few days later to an underwater phase using an autonomous underwater vehicle and a bathymetry survey covering an area around 430 miles (692km) long and 50 miles (80km) wide. June 2014 . Australian authorities issue a preliminary report in which they theorise that MH370's crew became incapacitated, possibly due to oxygen starvation, with the plane continuing on autopilot. August 28 . Australia's deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, says the aircraft 'might have turned south a little earlier than we have previously expected'. September 19 . After a four-month lull, it is announced that the underwater search, involving depths of up to 3.7 miles (6km), would resume at the end of September. October 2014 . The new underwater search involves ships dragging sonar devices called towfish through the water about 330ft (100m) above the seabed to hunt for wreckage. The towfish are equipped with jet fuel sensors and can transmit data to those on board the vessels. 2015 . January . Senior Boeing 777 captain Simon Hardy suggests the missing aircraft's final resting place is in the Indian Ocean just outside the far south-western edge of the core search area. January 28 . Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) officially declares the incident 'an accident'. The DCA says it had concluded the aircraft exhausted its fuel 'over a defined area of the southern Indian Ocean'. The DCA adds that efforts to find the plane will continue. March 7 . Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, says data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. April 14 .

Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal  is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today . While the images are 26 years old, investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses. Above, a man in a dark coloured jacket (left) and another in a beige jacket and grey hooded sweatshirt (right) who police believe may be able to help . Another of the fans in a distinctive white and red hat and a man seen tending to one of the wounded as they lay helpless on the football pitch (right) A man in a light denim jacket with long brown hair (left) is another person investigators believe may be able to help. Right, another person pictured in the appeal who was stuck behind the enclosure where fans were crushed . Another fan pictured in the appeal. Anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact Operation Resolve officers . While officers said it was 'unusual' to carry out such appeals as today's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact. 'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General’s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. The inquest continues. Ninety-six people were killed in the 1989 disaster (above). The conclusions of previous inquests were thrown out in 2012 with the Home Office launching a fresh probe .

9,"Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was suspended four matches on Thursday by the French league's disciplinary commission following his criticism of a referee last month. Following PSG's 3-2 loss at Bordeaux in the league on March 15, the Swede striker lost his temper and vented his anger on television at decisions which went against his side. Ibrahimovic, whose comments were caught on camera, insulted referee Lionel Jaffredo and one of his assistants, then used an expletive to describe France. Paris Saint-Germain ace Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss his side's matches against Nice, Lille, Metz and Nantes . Ibrahimovic has been banned for lambasting Lionel Jaffredo during his side's defeat against Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic, who later said he was sorry after the French sports minister asked him to apologise, is available for Saturday's League Cup final against Bastia as his suspension only starts next week. He will miss league games against Nice, Lille, Metz and Nantes and should return for the last three matches of the season. Although PSG sporting director Olivier Letang argued that Ibrahimovic should not be suspended because he did not address his comments directly to the referee, the disciplinary commission activated a suspended one-match ban imposed in January to add to the three games he received for the latest incident. Ibrahimovic, who took his tally with PSG to 102 goals in less than three years following his hat-trick in a 4-1 win over Saint-Etienne in the French Cup midweek, will also miss the first leg of his club's Champions League quarter-finals against Barcelona after he was sent off against Chelsea in the previous round and therefore suspended for one match. Ibrahimovic has scored 102 goals for PSG since joining the Ligue 1 outfit in July 2012 . Ibrahimovic's comments in Bordeaux caused an outcry in France, with National Front leader Marine Le Pen suggesting that he should leave the country if he was not happy. The Swede's suspension is a tough blow to PSG's ambitions as Laurent Blanc's team chases an unprecedented quadruple with a squad already missing several key players through injuries. Ibrahimovic has been in tremendous form recently, completing two hat-tricks in three games and scoring 10 goals in his last six matches for club and country. The 33-year-old Ibrahimovic has never been shy of controversy during his much-travelled career. He described the Chelsea players as a bunch of 'babies' after he was sent off for a late challenge on Oscar in the first half of PSG's match at Stamford Bridge last month.","PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss his side's next four league games .

10,"They had only one shot at it, with the masked raider wriggling clear of security in the 88th minute and making his way into the penalty area undetected. This was the second London heist in a week, with the Loftus Road imposter easily identifiable when he whipped off his head gear in front of QPR’s stunned supporters. Cesc Fabregas was the diamond when he worked the opening, following the carefully laid out plans of Eden Hazard and substitute Oscar to pull off this unlikely job for Chelsea. The finish called for precision. Cesc Fabregas arrives late on to convert Eden Hazard's pass and secure all three points for Chelsea at Loftus Road . Fabregas celebrates with Branislav Ivanovic after scoring a late goal which was harsh on QPR, but sent Chelsea seven clear . Jose Mourinho’s team are within inches of the silverware — the Barclays Premier League crown — after this dramatic game of smash and grab. Rob Green had been on guard throughout, but the crestfallen Rangers keeper made the mistake that allowed Chelsea to extend their lead at the top of the table again. You snooze, you lose. It was an important victory for Mourinho, keeping Arsenal at arm’s length by recording their 22nd victory of the season in the Premier League. ‘We have been at the top throughout,’ he declared. Nemanja Matic hugs his goalscoring team-mate Fabregas as Joey Barton and Charlie Austin look on dejected at the final whistle . Charlie Austin lets fly from long range, the best effort for either side in a first half lacking quality in front of goal . Where they rank among the great teams to win the title, such as the Manchester United vintages (1999 and 2009) or Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ (2004) — is of no concern to the Portuguese. Chelsea’s manager has put together a team to win the league, grinding down the opposition until they eventually lift the trophy, probably later this month. They are relentless, we know that. Here at Loftus Road they were met with the resistance of their noisy neighbours QPR, surviving the screams and shouts from the stands to stretch their lead over Arsenal to seven points. Thibaut Courtois made a stunning save to deny Austin, as Chelsea's Belgian goalkeeper kept QPR's forwards at bay . They will meet at the Emirates on April 26, but Chelsea are equipped to survive the sternest and stiffest tests that domestic competition can throw at them. Even Arsene Wenger knows a title-winning team when he sees one. Chelsea had only one shot on target, an improbable statistic for a team that can call upon the dancing feet of Hazard, Willian, substitute Oscar and Fabregas. Joey Barton (above) was everywhere for QPR, but Ramires (below) failed to have much impact. CLICK HERE to see more from Match Zone . QPR: Green 5.5, Isla 6.5 (Dunne 90 mins), Onuoha 7, Caulker 7, Hill 7, Phillips 6.5, Barton 6.5, Sandro 6.5 (Kranjcar 81 6), Henry 6.5, Austin 6.5, Zamora 6.5 (Hoilett 83 5.5) Subs not used: McCarthy, Mitchell, Grego-Cox, Comley . Booked: Zamora, Sandro . Chelsea: Courtois 7.5, Ivanovic 6.5, Cahill 6.5, Terry 7, Azpilicueta 7, Ramires 5 (Oscar 56 6), Matic 6, Willian 6.5 (Cuadrado 80 5.5), Fabregas 6.5 (Zouma 90), Hazard 6, Drogba 6. Subs not used: Cech, Luis, Mikel, Brown . Booked: Drogba . Goal: Fabregas 88 . Referee: Andre Marriner . Man of the Match: Courtois . Ratings by Sami Mokbel . Chelsea were careless in possession, knocked out of their rhythm by the boisterous presence of Karl Henry, Sandro and the bristling figure of Joey Barton strung out across the QPR midfield. This defeat feels tough on them because anyone who can sedate Nemanja Matic and Ramires over the course of 90 minutes probably deserves a bit more. The pair were over-run in that Chelsea midfield. Rangers have found an outlet in the willing, emerging figure of Matt Phillips down their right flank. They have to use and abuse him to stand a chance of staying up. Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta wins the ball from QPR's in-form winger Matt Phillips as the league leaders attempted to control the game . He looked to be their one chance of making something happen, a shuttlecock on that halfway line as he flitted in and out of Chelsea’s half. Cesar Azpilicueta will be glad to see the back of him. So will Gary Cahill, the Chelsea defender who bravely intercepted Phillips’s dangerous first-half crosses from that cultured right boot. Phillips was a menace on that wing. He had a massive chance to put Rangers in front at the start of the second half, denied by the anticipation of Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois when the Belgian moved to his left to turn the shot away for a corner. Joey Barton battles with Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas, who was wearing a mask after a collision with Charlie Adam against Stoke last week . When that failed, Rangers went old school, lofting balls into the box in the hope that forwards Bobby Zamora or Charlie Austin would get their head onto one of them. Even against Chelsea captain John Terry and the commanding presence of Cahill, the agricultural approach almost worked. Terry was hammered by QPR fans, choking on the abuse from the stands because of his exchange here with their former centre half Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Didier Drogba, starting in the absence of Diego Costa and Loic Remy, is tackled by Steven Caulker at Loftus Road . John Terry, whose every touch was booed by the Loftus Road crowd, wins the ball ahead of Bobby Zamora to clear the danger . Chelsea’s captain has learned to deal with it, but the trip to Loftus Road is possibly as poisonous as it gets for Terry. He can take his medicine. Rangers were shooting from anywhere, with Austin’s looping effort falling neatly into Courtois’ arms from long range and later drawing a stunning save to the keeper’s right with another poke from distance. Even Barton shanked an effort wide of Courtois’ goal when he was put clean through after the break. They gave this a right, old-fashioned go. Clint Hill puts in a tough tackle on Chelsea's Brazilian winger Willian as QPR battled hard and matched Chelsea in the first half . Loftus Road was a bear pit, with just under 20,000 Rangers crammed into this stadium to watch them match their west London rivals for blood and guts. Under manager Chris Ramsey, they have renewed their faith. Rangers have given themselves a chance of getting out of the mess at the foot of the table after that handsome 4-1 win at West Brom earlier this month, followed by a 3-3 draw with Aston Villa. There is a noticeable shift in mentality, pulling together as they approach the final five games — West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester — of the season. Three are winnable. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck (left) and owner Roman Abramovich share a joke as they watch their team in action at Loftus Road . The Russian was celebrating his 700th game as Chelsea owner since taking over the west London club in 2003 . Terry has to stretch to stop the ball getting through to Zamora as the hosts created the better chances in the first half . Gary Cahill stuck tight to Austin as the QPR front two caused plenty of problems with their direct style of play . Terry clashed with Austin on a number of occasions, in particular when he felt the QPR striker had followed through on Courtois . Chelsea are masters at this, calling on the pedigree of Hazard, in his 100 appearance in the Premier League, Oscar and the timing of Fabregas to secure this narrow win. It was their first chance, the only time in this game when they properly opened up the central defensive pairing of Steven Caulker and Nedum Onuoha. The man in the mask was there to finish the job, scoring in the league for the first time since Chelsea won 2-0 on the road at Stoke on December 22. ‘It’s like failing a driving test,’ admitted QPR’s manager. Here at Loftus Road, Fabregas turned out to be the getaway driver. A QPR fan shouts abuse at Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Oscar as the player prepares to take a corner late on .

11,"Hundreds of mourners have gathered  to farewell three children who died when their mother's car crashed into a Melbourne lake. Bol Manyang, one, his four-year-old sister Hanger and her twin brother Madit were laid to rest in tiny white coffins at St Andrew's Church in Werribee on Saturday morning. Their mother Akon Guode and father Joseph Tito Manyang sat in the church's front row, alongside older sister Awel, 5, who survived the horrifying crash on April 8. Scroll down for video . The three children who died when their mother's car crashed into a late in Melbourne have been laid to rest . Mourners held on to each other outside the church as the tiny coffins were wheeled inside. Sudanese AFL footballer Majak Daw arrived at the church and signed a book of condolences for the children before making his way inside. During the ceremony, mourners wept as the children's cousin, Makok Kuol, described them as 'three beautiful angels'. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Kuol told the congregation from the pulpit that four-year-old Madit was destined for great things. The crash  killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . 'Everyone who came to my family's house, you would feel the joy of having this boy run up into your arms,' Mr Kuol said . 'A young, energetic Australian has been ripped from us by the work of the devil. Mr Kuol paid tribute to his 'sweetheart' cousin Anger and said her younger brother BoI was a precious young boy, who will be remembered for 'the best smile, the laughter, and the joy he brought to all of us.' After the ceremony the children were taken to the Werribee Cemetery where they were buried. Mourners wept and clung on to each other as the tiny white coffins were wheeled into the church . Police are still investigating how the car ran off the road and ended up in a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's west on April 8 . Police are still investigating how the car ran off the road and ended up in a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's west on April 8. Ms Guode, who was driving, was interviewed after the crash but was released without charge. Police are appealing for witnesses including a woman, believed to be in her 30s, who was walking with a pram near Lake Gladman at Wyndham Vale and may have seen the crash before alerting others. Investigators are also appealing for further help from the South Sudanese community including anyone who knows the family's movements the day of the accident. Last week it was revealed that five-year-old Awel who survived the crash, believes her three siblings who died were eaten by crocodiles. Joseph Tito Manyang (left), the father of three children killed, held hands with a friend as they walked from the church with pink booklets in their hands . Akon Guode (centre), the mother of three children was inconsolable as she witnessed her children being buried . Awel (left) survived the accident that killed her siblings and believes they were eaten by crocodiles . The young girl believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Their father, Joseph Tito Manyang, said Awel remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody last Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told them she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. Ms Guode had been sent to stay with a relative following the crash, after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. Akon Guode told Police she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her kids crying out . She was released from custody after police questioning . 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. Sudanese AFL footballer Majak Daw was seen at the service . Mr Daw signed a book of condolences for the kids, who were of Sudanese decent . 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on the Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. Mr Daw paid tribute to the children and showed his respects by attending their funeral . Awel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site last week, where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' The tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children . The 2005 Toyota Kluger is expected to be removed from the lake late on Thursday morning . The family with seven children moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008 . Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Victoria police said that the exact circumstances of how the car went into the lake are yet to be determined .

13,"JT’s NEVER BEEN BETTER . Jose Mourinho's return was the answer to John Terry’s prayers. Mourinho said Sunday's game at the Emirates was the best Terry had ever played. That was a pat on the back for his captain but also justification for Mourinho’s faith in playing him. Terry is in a real purple patch and his reading of the game is better than ever. Part of his success comes from the way the team is set up in front of him. All of their good work means he is in prime position each time to make the telling tackle or interception. John Terry (left) was in inspiring form in the Chelsea defence as his side kept a clean sheet against Arsenal . Sportsmail's Martin Keown says the Blues skipper is enjoying some of the best football of his career . The 34-year-old defender's timing in the tackle has been impeccable for the majority this season . His decision-making is excellent and he waits for the perfect moment to get involved — there can be an element of gambling with that but it is a calculated risk. He was always able to anticipate where Arsenal wanted to play the game and stop them from doing it. As Chelsea have become harder to beat, Terry has come into his own. Following an entertaining first half, Arsenal's tempo appeared to drop after the half time break . GHOSTS OF MONACO? In the first half Arsenal played at a terrific tempo, especially down the left, but the whistle came at the perfect time for Chelsea. After the break Arsenal didn’t move the ball quickly enough. They looked mindful of the Monaco game where they lost control but here there was not enough spark. Gunners striker Olivier Giroud had a frustrating afternoon against a rugged Chelsea defence . Danny Welbeck's pace through the middle could have instead caused the Chelsea back line a lot trouble . A MISSED OPPORTUNITY . I’m a big fan of Olivier Giroud but Arsenal needed to ask a different question of the Chelsea defence. John Terry and Gary Cahill are built to deal with players like Giroud and everything was played in front of them. If Danny Welbeck had played through the middle, his pace could have unsettled Chelsea. It’s much easier to be compact when there’s no threat in behind. The Arsenal supporters were heard lamenting Chelsea's 'boring' performance at the Emirates Stadium . Despite many questioning Chelsea's tactics in the big games Jose Mourinho's team are in full control . JOSE IS ALWAYS THE BOSS . The Arsenal fans said it was boring but Chelsea are doing what they need to do to see out a championship. There is no problem with that. If anything that element of control is something Arsenal would do well to copy. Yes, there was no striker but could Didier Drogba really play three games in a row at 37? Jose just made good use of his squad. At the start of the season Chelsea played with so much expression it looked like the players were in charge. Now they look dogged, disciplined and firmly in control. There is no doubt as to who is the boss now.","Martin Keown: Danny Welbeck's pace might have unsettled Chelsea .

The Stoke midfielder has been the talk of football this Easter weekend after his incredible 66-yard goal against Chelsea. Adam's sweetly struck left-footed strike gave goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois absolutely no chance. Scroll down to watch video of Charlie Adam scoring from the halfway line in 2009 .

The goalkeeper is left sprawled on the floor as the ball hits the back of the net . And that is not the first time the Scot has had a goalkeeper frantically back-pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net. Back in 2009, Adam scored a similar effort for Blackpool reserves against Accrington Stanley. He was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with David Beckham's famous goal against Wimbledon in 1996. The stage, it has to be said, was far smaller too, though it's easy to see why Adam backed himself at Stamford Bridge on this evidence.","Charlie Adam scored brilliant long range goal against Chelsea on Saturday .

15,"David Cameron will say that high taxes are 'immoral' as 14 million working households receive a tax cut . David Cameron will say today that high taxes and wasteful government spending are ‘immoral’ as millions receive a tax cut. As 14million working households – more than nine in ten – are given an average boost of £200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money – because they ‘know best’ how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on ‘bureaucracy’ and ‘crackpot Government schemes’. ‘There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers’ money,’ he will say. ‘And we believe it’s people – not politicians – who know best how to spend their own money. And that’s what today is all about.’ He will add that it is ‘wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees’. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub ‘money back Monday’, are: . Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to £15,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of £17 a month. And nearly million pensioner households – more than nine in ten – will benefit by £15 a month. Middle income households earning around £23,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a ‘better and fairer place to live’, adding that low taxes ‘go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. ‘For me, there’s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. ‘There’s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. ‘But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.’ He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit ‘without reaching into working people’s pockets like Labour would’. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they’ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? ‘The truth is millions are worse off because of this government’s choices. ‘And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less.

16,"Winger Dom Manfredi stole the limelight from Ben Flower and Sam Tomkins as Wigan thrilled a 14,175 crowd at the DW Stadium with an exciting 30-20 win over Warrington. Most eyes before kick-off were on Welsh international Flower as he prepared to make his return from a six-month suspension imposed for punching Lance Hohaia in October's Grand Final defeat by St Helens. And the Wigan fans were delighted at half-time when the club announced the re-signing of Tomkins on a four-year deal from New Zealand Warriors, starting next season. Wigan winger Dom Manfredi scored a hat-trick for the second time in five days . All eyes were on Ben Flower on Thursday night as he made his return from a six-month ban after being sent off for punching Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens last October. RECEPTION: Flower's name was greeted with huge cheers when the team announcement was made 10 minutes before kick-off and there was a deafening roar 23 minutes into the match when he made his entrance, with Wigan fans on their feet for a standing ovation. PERFORMANCE: The Welshman came up with a knock-on four minutes into his return and clearly looked rusty after his lengthy lay-off. He produced some strong charges, however, and did his fair share of tackling before taking a breather after 32 minutes. Flower later returned for the last four minutes, by which time his side were firmly in charge. OVERALL: A steady if unspectacular return for the former Crusaders front rower in a match dominated by the tryscoring prowess of his young outside back team-mates. Unsurprisingly rusty at times, he will be better for his 36-minute contribution, made in two spells. By the end of a pulsating derby, however, it was the name of 21-year-old Manfredi which was on most people's lips after he scored a second hat-trick in five days. Manfredi had touched down three times in Wigan's 34-0 win over Catalans Dragons on Sunday and he once more demonstrated his exceptional ability to finish off the Wolves after they had taken the lead for a third time early in the second half. Warrington could hardly have made a better start, scoring two tries inside the first 10 minutes as they monopolised the early play. Skipper Joel Monaghan had gone close in the opening moments after gathering Richie Myler's high kick to the corner and he enjoyed an unopposed run-in after taking Stefan Ratchford's cut-out pass to open the scoring. Ratchford added the touchline conversion and the visitors increased their lead when Chris Bridge went through the attempted tackle of his opposite number Dan Sarginson for the first of his two tries. Wigan barely had touched the ball at that stage but they quickly demonstrated their attacking flair with two superbly-crafted touchdowns. Stand-off George Williams came up with a break for the first but it was a magnificent final pass from winger Joe Burgess that enabled England second rower Liam Farrell to finish off the move . Ben Flower (centre) returned to action after serving six-month ban for punching Lance Hohaia . Moments later Sydney-bound Burgess was again the provider as full-back Ryan Hampshire, making amends for the first of two bad handling errors, went over for the Warriors' second try, with Matty Smith's second goal edging his side in front. That was the signal for Wigan coach Shaun Wane to reintroduce Flower but there was little scope for the forwards to get into the action as the outside backs continued to dominate. The lead changed hands twice more before half-time, with Bridge going through Sarginson for his second try - only for Manfredi to cancel it out by taking advantage of some outrageous offloads from Anthony Gelling and Joel Tomkins to score his first. Forward Flower enjoyed a low key return as the Wigan backs ran Warrington ragged in the second half . Leading 16-14 at the break, the highly-impressive Gelling twice took the wrong option as Wigan were the first to attack in the second half and the misses began to look costly when when Warrington second rower Ben Currie sliced through the home defence for his side's fourth try to put them back in front. Wigan were not to be denied, however, and Manfredi went over twice in eight minutes to complete his hat-trick and apply the finishing touches to a splendid victory. The hosts produced some quick hands to get him over on 61 minutes but it needed a huge slice of good fortune for him to complete his hat-trick, with Smith's drop-goal attempt charged down and falling nicely for the big winger after Gelling had instinctively put his boot to the loose ball.","Wigan winger Dom Manfredi scored a hat-trick of tries on Thursday night .

17,"Killed: Police are investigating the alleged murder of Syrian-born imam Abdul Hadi Arwani . A fourth person has been arrested over the alleged murder of a Syrian imam who was shot dead in his car on a London street. Police announced today that they had arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Abdul Hadi Arwani, who was killed in Wembley two weeks ago. A Jamaican businessman has already appeared in court charged with Mr Arwani's murder, while a man and a woman were arrested this week on suspicion of terror offences. The father of six, who was an imam at a controversial mosque in west London, was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat on April 7. Leslie Cooper, 36, appeared at the Old Bailey on Thursday, where the court was told that Mr Arwani, 48, was lured to a meeting with a potential customer for his construction business before being killed. Burnell Mitchell, 61, the brother of Boney M's lead singer, was arrested this week on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. A 53-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are both in Metropolitan Police custody while counter-terror officers continue to investigate Mr Arwani's killing. Police said in a statement today that they had arrested the fourth suspect, a 35-year-old man, on Friday, before releasing him on bail today. Suspects: Leslie Cooper, left, appeared in court charged with murder while Burnell Mitchell, right, has been arrested on suspicion of terror offences . Mr Arwani was previously a preacher at the An-Noor mosque in Acton but resigned after he apparently fell out with other community leaders. The mosque was founded by Mr Mitchell 20 years ago after he converted to Islam, and he remains a trustee of the centre as well as a director of the company which owns its premises. Mr Mitchell, whose sister Liz Mitchell was the lead singer of Boney M, was brought up a strict Christian before changing faith and becoming known as 'Khalid Rashad'. Both his home and the mosque were searched by police last week as part of the investigation into Mr Arwani's death. Mosque: Police standing outside the An-Noor cultural centre in Acton earlier this week . The Syrian-born imam fled his home country in the 1980s and became an outspoken opponent of president Bashar al-Assad's regime before his killing. Mr Arwani's son Murhaf said last week: 'He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it.

18,"A man had to be airlifted to the hospital after being bit by a shark Friday afternoon while spearfishing on the coast of Florida. The bull shark took a bite out of his back, torso and head, according to witnesses in Palm Beach, Florida. Blood covered the boat which was anchored off the Jupiter Inlet, a hot spot for fishing. Horrific: This is the man who was bitten by a shark on the right side of his head as well as his back and torso . The victim, who has not been identified, was airlifted to St Mary's Medical Center's trauma unit. An update on his condition wasn't immediately available. The man had a cobia fish and sling-type spears aboard the boat, where he was fishing with a man and a woman, who both spoke Spanish. 'He was bleeding quite a bit,' witness Peter Pinello told WPBF. 'It looks like a shark had gotten him in the torso. You could see his wetsuit was embedded in it, and it looked like it took a good chunk of it out.' The man was spearfishing off Jupiter Inlet when he was bitten, according to ABC affiliate WPBF-TVin West Palm Beach. Pinello told WPBF he saw the victim when he was being brought back to shore. Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Battalion Chief John Vanek told WPBF that the victim was bitten on the head but was conscious when he was flown to the hospital. Bull sharks are common near the coast, particularly in Florida, with a preference for water less than 100 feet deeo. They target their prey in murky water where they are not easily visible. According to a study on the behavior of sharks at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, bull sharks are attracted to colorful clothing - but have the ability to recognize brightly-colored netted traps.","Victim had been fishing off Palm Beach's Jupiter Inlet when he was bitten .

20,"A police officer has been charged with leaking confidential information about the arrest of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins to his reporter girlfriend. Channel 7 Perth news reporter Monique Dirksz got the scoop on Cousins' arrest when she was the only journalist outside Freemantle Police station at 2am on March 12 when he was released on bail. The troubled star was arrested on March 11 over an alleged low-speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park, in Perth. First Class Constable Daniel Jamieson is said to have been dating Ms Dirksz at the time and is accused of divulging information that gave her a particular advantage, WA Today reports. Scroll down for video . Officer Daniel Jamieson (left) is accused of leaking confidential information about Ben Cousins' arrest in March to his girlfriend Channel 7 Perth news reporter Monique Dirksz . Police investigators became suspicious when Ms Dirksz (right) and her cameraman were the only people outside Freemantle Police station at 2am on March 12 when Cousins (left) was granted bail . Acting Police Commissioner Steve Brown said the policeman allegedly looked up the information on a police computer. The 29-year-old was stood down immediately and has been charged with four counts of disclosing official secrets between March 11 and 17, 2015. At 11:00am on March 12, Ms Dirksz tweeted: ‘Ben Cousins arrested after police pursuit. Charged with Reckless Driving, Fail to Stop and Failure to Provide a Sample of Breath.’ Mr Brown said Ms Dirksz had done nothing wrong but told 6PR Mornings radio Mr Jamieson’s alleged offences were an ‘absolute breach of trust not only for this agency but for the community at large’. Mr Jamieson will appear in Perth Magistrates Court on May 5. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Dirksz for comment. Monique Dirksz got the scoop on Cousins' arrest. Officer Jamieson accused of divulging information that gave her a particular advantage . At 11:00am on March 12, Ms Dirksz tweeted: ‘Ben Cousins arrested after police pursuit. Charged with Reckless Driving, Fail to Stop and Failure to Provide a Sample of Breath.’ Acting Police Commissioner Steve Brown confirmed Ms Dirksz had done nothing wrong . Mr Brown is also concerned about the 112 police officers who had accessed Cousins’ confidential files 300 times in two days, some of whom were working in regional WA. ‘We want to know why they have accessed these records. It's a breach of trust,’ Mr Brown said. Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents. Mr Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'.

Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events.

The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8, when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued.

Goals have been hard to come by for the Colombian, with just four being netted by the striker this season in a United shirt having signed on a season-long loan from Monaco. But not only has Falcao failed to score since January 31 against Leicester, he has also failed to have a shot on target in the Premier League - featuring in 10 games since.During that period he has collected £3,080,000 in wages.

Falcao stands dejected with Wayne Rooney at the final whistle following United's 1-0 loss at Chelsea . Falcao looks on with Marouane Fellaini waiting to kick-off following Eden Hazard's strike . Granted, Falcao has not always featured for the Red Devils but the striker's £280,000-a-week wages are a massive burden for United, making a permanent move this summer even more unlikely despite the uncertain future of strike partner Robin van Persie. Falcao started in Manchester United's 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, but despite playing the full 90 minutes for a side that bossed over 70 per cent of the ball, he struggled to get involved in the game. The striker saw a shot blocked by Gary Cahill and had another two shots fly wide in the second half. But otherwise the Colombian's biggest impact was a negative one as he lost the ball following a John Terry challenge in the build up to Eden Hazard's winning goal at Stamford Bridge. Following another failed audition in front of manager Louis van Gaal, Falcao's Premier League adventure is set to go down as a costly mistake for the Red Devils.

22,"Google Wallet says it has changed its policy when storing users' funds as they will now be federally-insured (file photo) For those who use Google Wallet, their money just became safer with federal-level insurance. Google confirmed to Yahoo Finance in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service (similar to PayPal and Venmo) in multiple federally-insured banking institutions. This is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their Wallet Balance because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000. Currently, Google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the FDIC. However, a Google spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the current policy has changed. The policy states that 'funds held by Google Payment Corp. or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Payment Transactions are not deposit obligations of Buyer, and are not insured for the benefit of Buyer by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency', according to 9to5. As a non-banking institution, Google Wallet, along with PayPal and Venmo, is not legally required to be federally insured. But with the new change to its policy, funds in Wallet Balance are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy. For example, for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not FDIC insured, if a company files for bankruptcy, the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back. But for users with FDIC insurance, they would receive their money from the government in a matter of days, according to Yahoo Finance. Details on when Google Wallet's user agreement will be updated were not provided. How Google Wallet works: . Google Wallet, launched in 2011, stores credit and debit card information, and lets shoppers pay for goods by tapping their phones against special terminals at store checkout counters. It works with any debit or credit card, on every mobile carrier. The service allows users to send money to anyone in the US with a Gmail address, or request money on-the-go, directly from their bank account, debit card or Wallet Balance. Users can spend received money through the service in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs with the Google Wallet Card, as well as transfer the funds directly to their bank account. It comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring, and users can disable their Wallet app or card from their Google Wallet account if they're ever lost or stolen. Source: Google Wallet . Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected Google Inc's request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the technology company of invading the privacy of users of its Google Wallet electronic payment service by sharing their personal information with outside app developers. The judge said Google must face claims it breached users' contracts, violated the federal Stored Communications Act which limits disclosure of electronic records, and violated a California consumer protection law. Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California said Google Wallet users may try to show that Google 'frustrated' the purpose of its own privacy policy by allowing 'blanket, universal disclosure' of their personal information to app developers whenever they bought apps in Google's Play Store. The lead plaintiff is Alice Svenson, an Illinois resident who said Google sent unnecessary personal information about her to YCDroid when she paid that developer $1.77 for an email app. She said Google raised the risk of identity theft by routinely sending information about Google Wallet users such as addresses and zip codes, phone numbers and email addresses to app developers. Svenson said the Mountain View, California-based company ceased the practice soon after the lawsuit was filed in September 2013. Her lawsuit seeks class-action status, damages of $1,000 per violation, punitive damages and other remedies.","Google spokesperson confirmed current policy changed meaning funds will be protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .

23,"Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond today held talks with Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman - just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the BBC. The resignation  marks another blow for the hugely-popular show, which has been marred by uncertainty since Clarkson was axed  last month following a  'fracas' with a producer. It means Mr Wilman, a childhood friend of Clarkson who helped revamp Top Gear into the Corporation's most successful programme, is now free to reunite with the team on a rival channel. There is widespread speculation that the men are  working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster - in what would be a nightmare scenario for the BBC. Scroll down for video . Back together: Jeremy Clarkson (left) is seen with his Top Gear colleagues James May (centre) and Richard Hammond (right) outside his  west London flat, in their first public appearance since he was sacked . Discussions: Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman (front centre) was also present at the meeting today, just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the BBC, in what is another blow for the show . Presenters: May had earlier said the BBC would be 'stupid' to try a version of the hit motoring show with 'a surrogate Jeremy', Richard Hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a ‘non-starter’ Something to smile about? The presenter looked in high spirits as he left the property with Mr Wilman. A BBC spokesman would not comment on the producer's resignation other than to confirm it . Put it there: Hammond and Clarkson shake hands as they part ways on a west London street . The men were photographed today outside Clarkson's home in west London - their first public appearance together since the presenter was dropped from Top Gear - before moving on to a pub. Earlier today, May ruled out returning to Top Gear without Clarkson, insisting it would be 'lame' with a new presenter in place of his sacked co-host. The 52-year-old said the BBC would be ‘stupid’ to try a version of the programme with 'a surrogate Jeremy', Hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a ‘non-starter’. His comments mean that if the show does return next year, it will likely be with an entirely new presenting team. Both May and Hammond saw their contracts finish last month. Casual: Speaking  today, May, pictured tonight, said he had just been 'having a pint' with his co-stars . May told The Guardian: ‘Me and Hammond with a surrogate Jeremy is a non-starter, it just wouldn’t work. That would be lame, or “awks” as young people say. ‘It has to be the three of us. You can’t just put a surrogate Jeremy in and expect it to carry on. It would be forced. I don’t believe they would be stupid enough to try that. ‘It doesn’t mean I won’t go back - we may all go back in the future. It might just be we have a break from it. I don’t know. It would be a bloody tough call to do Top Gear without Jeremy.’ Former X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, model Jodie Kidd and Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins have all been named as possible replacements for Clarkson. Speaking after the meeting today, May said he had just been 'having a pint' with his co-stars and Mr Wilman, adding that he still didn't know what he would do in the future. This evening, a BBC spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Wilman, Top Gear's longstanding executive producer and Clarkson's right-hand man, had handed  bosses his resignation. She would not say whether or not the decision was related to the outspoken presenter. It comes just weeks after an email from Mr Wilman to colleagues titled 'au revoir' was leaked. In the email, the 52-year-old, who has  made millions from the show, congratulated staff on making 'one of the most iconic programmes in TV history'. 'At least we left 'em wanting more. And that alone, when you think about it, is quite an achievement for a show that started 13 years ago,' he wrote. After the email was leaked, Mr Wilman announced publicly that it had not been a resignation. The revelations today come after BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a replacement for Clarkson on Top Gear, said the presenter ‘will be back on the BBC’ at some point. Leaving: Hammond arrived at the flat first, before May came in a BMW car - followed by Mr Wilman's arrival . Waving: It comes a day after BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a replacement for Clarkson (left) on Top Gear, said the 55-year-old presenter ‘will be back on the BBC’ at some point . Keeping mum: The group has not yet revealed whether it will work together on another car programme . Miss Shillinglaw also confirmed Clarkson's final Top Gear scenes will be screened later this year and she was not thinking of his replacement ‘in terms of gender’. Clarkson was sacked by the BBC after an ‘unprovoked physical and verbal’ attack in North Yorkshire that left his victim, Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, in need of hospital treatment. The star was suspended last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Mr Tymon, 36, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him. Clarkson's contract was not renewed, with director-general Tony Hall saying at the time 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'.

Victim: Clarkson was suspended last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured), 36, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him . Clarkson said he considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall-out from the incident, but has since stated that he expects to present another TV show on cars in the future. Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel in Hawes. Meanwhile, Clarkson revealed in a newspaper column earlier this month that he was told by a doctor that he might have cancer, two days before assaulting Mr Tymon. Top Gear - which is said to generate about £50million a year for BBC Worldwide - is viewed by more than six million viewers on BBC2 and watched in more than 200 countries.

The Polish prince, who lives in Ealing, West London, begins his video by introducing a gold sculpture of his father, Captain Andrzej Zylinski. The cavalry officer led a victorious charge against the Nazis in Kaluszyn, near Warsaw, in 1939, helping to save 6,000 Jews. In the online video he declares that he has had enough of the discrimination against immigrants from people such as Mr Farage. He said: 'I've had enough of the discrimination against Polish people in this country.' Mr Zylinski added: 'The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40.' The prince says a duel with swords is what any self-respecting 18th Century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would do. But Zylinski also offers up an alternative way to settle their differences. He says that 'if his sword is a little rusty, we could meet in a studio for a duel of words in the run up to the election.' The Ukip leader was today forced to defend his stance on immigration after meeting an Eastern European worker during a factory tour in Essex. Nigel Farage, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, chats to a supporter during campaigning in Clacton, Essex . Mr Farage (centre) and parliamentary candidate for Clacton Douglas Carswell (left) meet staff during a visit to hinge manufacturer NICO in Clacton, Essex . Mr Farage was visiting hinge manufacturer NICO in Clacton as he spoke of the need to boost manufacturing and improve skills among British workers. During a tour of one of the factory's workshops, he met Hungarian Ivan Loncsarevity, 62, who has lived in Colchester for five years after travelling to the UK for work. Mr Loncsarevity could not answer questions as he does not speak any English but was described by colleagues as 'relatively low-skilled'. The firm's manufacturing manager Steve Dalton confirmed that the company needed to look to Eastern Europe to fill a skills gap and on occasion had flown potential employees from Poland. Mr Farage displayed his Union Flag themed socks out campaigning today . Asked about the encounter and whether Mr Loncsarevity should be working in the UK, Mr Farage said: 'Ukip has never said anyone should leave the country, so the question is entirely baseless. 'One of the big problems that we've got in engineering is a real shortage of young people studying engineering to go into trades such as this, which is regrettable. 'We've got rid of technical colleges and encouraged more and more young people to go to university and study degrees which are not directly linked to industry such as this. 'If there's no British person trained to do that job, then that says more about us than them.' Mr Dalton said he was not a Ukip supporter but did not oppose the party's proposal of an Australian-style points system designed to limit the number of immigrants. He said: 'There needs to be some controls but presumably, if we needed to fill a skills gap, we would still be able to do that under such a system.' The company employs 130 people, six of whom are migrants from Eastern Europe. Finance director Gillian Hagger said: 'A lot of industries in the UK do need migrant workers. 'The area we're in means we've got a large pool to recruit from but sometimes we find their skills are limited. 'On those occasions we have had to look further afield, including flying interviewees in from Poland.' Later Mr Farage visited the town's Copping Community Centre with Douglas Carswell - the first person to be elected as a Ukip MP after defecting from the Conservatives. He met supporters and again spoke of the lack of young British people pursuing careers in manufacturing and leaving engineering firms with a 'genuine shortage' of skilled workers. He said: 'We will say that anyone doing engineering at degree level should not be paying any tuition fees.'","Janek Zylinski, the aristocratic son of Polish war hero, slams Mr Farage .

26,"President Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop to the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica last night while on a visit to the country for a meeting with Caribbean leaders. The first president to visit Jamaica in three decades, Obama arrived in Kingston yesterday evening and was met by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller, U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica Luis Moreno and a dozen other dignitaries. Obama promptly embraced the local color  by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island's most famous son. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica . The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit . On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981, Obama, looking relaxed in shirtsleeves, was shown a trophy room where Marley's Grammys and platinum records were on display. At the same time Marley's hit song 'One Love' played over the loudspeaker. The musician's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre, a photographic gallery, and a gift shop selling T-shirts, posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia. One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star's platinum records and a Grammy award. Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston . The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family . 'What a wonderful tour,' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark. 'I still have all the albums.' Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela's economic clout may be receding. The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008. Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor, the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him, and Antigua's highest mountain officially became 'Mount Obama' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement. Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley's albums . Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security . As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982, Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller, poorer neighbors. The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy, security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom. Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region. From Jamaica, Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions. Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December.","President Barack Obama in Jamaica for a meeting with Caribbean leaders .

27,"Thinking about vacating the White House  probably isn't President Obama's favorite thing to do, but it isn't his impending departure that stresses him the most - it's the prospect of his eldest daughter leaving 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and heading off to college that really gets him down. Malia Obama, 16, is already visiting colleges in preparation for when she heads to school in the fall of 2016. She hasn't even finished high school, but President Obama said the thought of her heading off to college has him crying on a daily basis. Empty nester: President Obama said the thought of Malia, 16. heading to college has him crying on a daily basis . Can't let her go: The 11th grade student (left) is already visiting schools and will go to college in the fall of 2016 . So sad: President Obama said he's 'sad' and he 'starts tearing up in the middle of the day and I can't explain it' He said on Tuesday during the Easter Prayer Breakfast: 'I start tearing up in the middle of the day and I can't explain it, why am I so sad? 'They're leaving me.' The 11th grade student, who attends the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., has already visited at UC Berkeley, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Harvard, Brown, Princeton, Yale and Wesleyan, the Washington Post reported. Malia's younger sister Sasha, 13, won't start thinking about college for a few years yet. Obama continued: 'I want to thank everybody here for their prayers, which means so much to me and Michelle, particularly at a time when my daughters are starting to grow up and starting to go on college visits. 'I need prayer.' Thankfully: Malia's (right) younger sister Sasha, 13 (center), won't start thinking about college for a few years yet . If Malia attends Columbia for an undergraduate degree, she will be following in her father's footsteps. However, based on comments he made in February when he addressed a cybersecurity summit on Stanford's  campus in Palo Alto, California, President Obama might want his daughter to go there. President Obama said of Stanford: 'I've got to admit, like, I kind of want to go here. 'I was trying to figure out why it is that a really nice place like this is wasted on young people who don't fully appreciate what you got. 'It's really nice. And everybody here is so friendly and smart, and it's beautiful. And what's there not to like?' 'Let's face it, I like Stanford grads.' The last president to send a child straight from the White House to college, Bill Clinton, sent daughter Chelsea to Stanford in the fall of 1997 to begin her freshman year. When she graduated in 2001, Bill and wife Hillary Rodham Clinton were there blowing kisses.

28,"The mother-of-five who police said threw her teenage daughter a party, played naked Twister with her friends and then had sex with an 18-year-old in the bathroom looked upset today as she walked outside her house. Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, was spotted outside her house wearing a hooded jacket and workout clothes just days after being arrested. She was arrested on Saturday night and has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Scroll down for video . Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, appeared to be stressed as she walked outside her house on Wednesday. She was arrested on Saturday after having a drunken party with her teenage daughter and daughter's friends . The mother-of-five has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and is out on bail . The details of the drunken party emerged when Lehnardt met with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor last Friday and told her about the wild party. The sponsor then contacted authorities. She told the woman that her children, who are aged between four and 16, were with their father when her oldest daughter texted her to ask if she could bring over some friends. Lehnardt allegedly responded: 'Come on, let's party', WJBF reported. When the teenagers arrived, she allegedly allowed them to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her home, before she played naked Twister with them in the living room. See more video at WJBF . She allegedly threw the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, and lost custody of her children after the incident . She allegedly played naked Twister with the group of teens before she had sex with an 18-year-old male in the bathroom. She later had sex with her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend . While the youngsters continued playing, she allegedly went into a bathroom and had sex with an 18-year-old man, the sponsor told authorities. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, she told her sponsor, Augusta Crime reported. She later went to bed alone and around 3.30am, she awoke to find someone having sex with her, she told her sponsor. 'She stated at first she thought it was the 18-year-old from earlier, but then realized it was the 16-year-old who was in fact her daughter's boyfriend,' Lehnardt's sponsor told deputies. Lehnardt told police that she awoke to find the 16-year-old having sex with her and that it was her teenage daughter's boyfriend . She also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend . The daughter told her mother she felt guilty because the boyfriend's 10-inch penis was so large she could not have sex with him, and he needed to have sex with her mother instead. While the incident sounds as if the 16-year-old raped the mother, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her current boyfriend. The sponsor said that the mother has also previously spoken about being a porn addict. Following the incident, an emergency custody hearing was held and she lost custody of her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, WJBF reported. Police became aware for the incident after Lehnardt told her Alcohol Anonymous sponsor about the party thrown in her Evans home (neighborhood pictured), and the sponsor alerted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office . At their meeting last week, the sponsor asked Lehnardt how long she had been sober and her future plans for sobriety, and the mother told her about losing custody of the children days before. After their meeting, the woman, who was only recently assigned to sponsor Lehnardt, contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office and the mother was arrested on Saturday. She has been released from the Columbia County Detention Center after posting a $3,200 bond, according to the Columbia County News-Times. According to online profiles, Lehnardt crafts and paints dolls. The children's father is in the military. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected.","Rachel Lehnardt, 35, 'allowed her 16-year-old daughter and her friends drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her Georgia home'

30,"The nation has yet to hear the first words of Prince George. But thanks to new puppet show Newzoids, we can at least get a version of them. In true satirical style, the 20-month-old has been cast as a blinged-up rascal with a tattoo on his arm. Teasers for the ITV programme – which starts tonight at 9pm – show the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge worrying that their son has turned out a little, well, common. Scroll down for video . 'Rascal': A new satire puppet show sees Prince George 'blinged-up' with a tattoo, addressing a female doctor with 'Oi, oi! Hello treacle' A doctor is called to assess his condition and the young prince bounces on screen with a big, gold ‘G’ pendant around his neck. The youngster says to the waiting female doctor ‘Oi, oi! Hello treacle. Is that a ladder in your tights or a stairway to heaven?’ before proceeding to smack her on the bottom. The plotline plays off newspaper headlines which dubbed his mother Kate the Commoner. Debra Stephenson, one of the show’s impressionists, admitted that mocking the royal family is a daunting task. ‘It feels extremely mischievous doing all those voices but it is done for fun. I don't know how it would be received. It's a very daunting thought,’ she told the Daily Mail.

The papers have dubbed Kate 'Kate the Commoner' but she is clearly not common in any way. 'But the idea is quite funny, the idea she could have this throwback gene to something like this.’ Another of the show’s impressionists, Jon Culshaw, best known for Dead Ringers, added: ‘It was an idea that chimed with the writers to have Prince George as a bit of a rascal who runs around saying “Oi, oi!”. It’s an absurd and funny extreme.’ Prince George and his parents will be joined on screen by the Queen, Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall in a series of sketches titled Mrs Crown’s Boys. Other famous faces on the Newzoids roll call are Ant and Dec, Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles, David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Barack Obama, Russell Brand and Simon Cowell.","Satire puppet show depicts Prince George as a 'blinged-up rascal'

We showed great maturity and quality and that’s 12 goals in out last three games. ‘To be on 85 points is sensational. If we win one more and get to 88 that will be a magnificent season. If we win them both and get 91 that’s unbelievable. If it’s not good enough to finish second we’ll go into the play-offs as the form team.’ Meanwhile, Preston remain in pole position to join champions Bristol City in the Championship next season as they stay a point ahead of the Dons after a 3-1 win at Notts County, who are staring relegation in the face. First-half goals from Jermaine Beckford and Joe Garner set up the success, before James Spencer got the Magpies back in it. But Beckford's second sealed it in the final 10 minutes to leave County two points adrift of safety with two games left. Swindon look destined for the play-offs after only managing a 3-3 draw with Walsall.

""You can walk around and you don't hear anything,"" said Kenneth Feld, who opened the center in 1995. ""These elephants, they have these large feet and they travel silently through the fields. I think it's very peaceful."" Twenty-nine elephants currently live here, and 13 more will join the group by 2018, after Ringling Bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus. ""This was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time,"" said Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, the company that owns Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. The change comes after years of repeated criticism and lawsuits by animal rights groups. The ultimate decision to phase out the elephants, Feld said, is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year. ""You can't operate any business, much less with animals, if you don't have consistency from city to city,"" Feld said. ""It's a definite expense to be in litigation and to be fighting legislation, and there is a saying and it's been around for a long time: 'You can't fight city hall.' And we found that to be the case in this situation."" The circus business has been a part of the Feld family since 1967, when Irvin Feld purchased Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. When Irvin died in 1984, his son, Kenneth, took over. ""This is a whole family affair,"" he said. ""It's a family affair for our family but also for all the elephants."" When the center opened 20 years ago, it housed fewer than 10 elephants. ""It was a place for elephants to retire,"" Feld said. Today, the center houses elephants of all ages. ""We have lots of different elephants, meaning males and females, youth elephants, older elephants, so it is a great place to study behavior,"" he said. The center is also focused on breeding the animals. Wendy Kiso, a research and conservation scientist, spends her days at an onsite lab, trying to figure out how to keep the species from going extinct. Part of her lab includes several tanks that ""cryo-preserve"" elephant sperm at negative-196 degrees. ""We process the semen and we extend it in such a way that we can freeze it,"" Kiso said. ""This is a genetic resource bank for Asian elephants."" Twenty-six elephants have been born here, Feld said. Mike, the newest pachyderm to join the group, was born at the center's birthing barn nearly two years ago. ""We have the largest and only sustainable herd of Asian elephants in the Western Hemisphere,"" Feld said. Caring for the elephants is no small task. Trudy Williams and her husband, Jim, spend their time taking care of the animals' daily needs. It takes the couple hours to bathe, walk and feed the elephants every day. ""First thing in the morning, we water them, and give them some treats and feed them some hay,"" Williams said. Each elephant eats about 150 pounds of food a day. Twenty-one tons of hay usually lasts only 10 days at the center. Exercise is also part of the daily routine, including stretching. ""We just do that a few times on each leg with them, just to give them a good stretch,"" Williams said.""We do some footwork with them. All of our elephants, generally once a month, get a pedicure, just to make sure their feet are in good condition."" All of this care isn't cheap. ""Each elephant costs over $65,000 a year, per year, over all the years of their life,"" Feld said. ""We're fortunate we're for profit. We do make a profit and we're a privately owned family business, and so we've made a decision we want to devote a lot of resources here."" It's a price Feld said he's willing to pay to keep this species -- some varieties of which in Asia and Africa are endangered -- alive for generations to come. ""I always say, it's sort of like Jurassic Park with a happy ending,"" Feld said. ""We knew that if we didn't do something, maybe my grandchildren would never have the opportunity to see these incredible animals."" CNN's Javier de Diego contributed to this report.","29 elephants currently live at the circus sanctuary, and 13 more will join by 2018 .

38,"A scientist says he expects to live to 150 after uncovering the secrets of how to slow down the ageing process. Dr Alex Zhavoronkov, an anti-ageing expert, believes medical advances and knowledge of lifestyles will lead to a far longer life expectancy than has been seen to date. He is following a strict regime of regular exercise combined with drugs and supplements and regular health checks, while shunning marriage, children and material assets to focus on anti-ageing research instead. Scroll down for video . Healthy living: Dr Alex Zhavoronkov, an anti-ageing expert, believes medical advances and knowledge of lifestyles will lead to a far longer life expectancy than has been seen to date . A director of the UK-based Biogerontology Research Foundation think tank, which is dedicated to longer life and improving the health of the elderly, Dr Zhavoronkov remains confident that his lifestyle will allow him to reach the 150-year milestone. He also makes sure he is administered with vaccines as soon as they are available, according to The Sunday Telegraph, while monitoring his blood biochemistry and cell counts. 'All of the supercentenarians alive today lived through tough times, when no antibiotics were available and our understanding of human biology was not that far from the Stone Age,' he said. 'I think that in two to three years we will have effective pharmacological solutions based on already approved drugs that will help people remain younger and healthier until other advances in regenerative medicine and gene therapy become available.' Secret to long life: Dr Zhavoronkov is combining drugs and supplements with frequent health checks (pictured) and regular exercise as part of his quest for longevity. He is confident he can live to 150 years old . According to the Office for National Statistics, a boy born in the UK today is expected to live to 78.8 years and a girl to 82.8 years. Many health experts think most people can exceed that by walking regularly, cutting down on fat, sugar and salt in their diets and using existing drugs such as statins. In fact, Austrian researchers said a few weeks ago that old age begins at 74, such has been the advancement in medicine and health.","Dr Alex Zhavoronkov, an anti-ageing expert, is confident he can live to 150 .

The owner of the Bunny Baker Cafe in Manila etches customised caricatures into coffee froth at no extra cost to his clientele, even detailing local favourite, boxer Manny Pacquiao. Graphic artist Zach Yonzon runs the cafe with his wife and uses steamed milk and froth as the canvas upon which he creates his masterpieces which can leave happy memories for tourists.

And the tools of his unique trade include a spoon and a barbecue skewer, which he dips in dark chocolate. The service started out as a simple novelty when the owner began etching rabbits, which coincide with the cafe's theme, into cups of coffee. But the idea quickly expanded when customers started asking for more intricate and complicated designs. This means tourists to the area can leave with a special memento from their time that they can show off to family and friends alike.

He says: 'They've never seen anything like that. The most that they've ever seen is a leaf or a heart, and that already makes them happy, but I want to go one step further. 'I want to go one step further and give them a picture of their baby, their boyfriend, or their favourite cartoon character. If that makes them happy, that makes them smile, that's cool.' According to the Mr Yonzon, the biggest challenge he faces is to get the picture etched into the froth before it dissolves and the coffee turns cold. But he claims that his art can be done with almost any type of coffee drink and that the final product will depend on the thickness of the beverage and the amount of froth that tops it.

Mr Yonzon has now started offering small workshops at night for those who wish to learn his craft as the cafe's popularity has continued to grow. Abi Radilla, a college student who enrolled at Yonzon's workshop, said: 'My parents love to drink coffee, so maybe I can do latte art whenever they drink.'

40,"Controversial plans to spend £3.2million pulling down a 19th century country mansion and building a 'Butlins-style' gipsy camp have been approved despite angry protests by neighbours. Villagers in the small country hamlet of Cledford, near Middlewich in Cheshire, had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could 'intimidate' nearby pensioners and may ruin the idyllic surroundings. But yesterday, Cheshire East Council gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting, which will create a 'transit site' with room for nine gipsy families. The 200-year-old Cledford Hall in the small hamlet of Cledford in Cheshire which is being knocked down to make way for a 'Butlins-style' gipsy camp costing £3.2million . People living in the village have reacted with fury about the plans saying travellers could intimidate nearby pensioners . The mansion's Grade-II listed adjoining barn will be converted into 'washing and toilet' facilities and office accommodation for a resident warden will also be provided at the expense of taxpayers. The cost of the project, revealed through a Freedom of Information request, has left locals stunned, and they now fear their picturesque cottages will be left worthless as they contemplate selling up and leaving the area. Formerly Grade II-listed Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its listing was cancelled. It will be fully demolished to make way for the site which will house gypsy families for a maximum of 28 days before they must move on. Around 100 letters of opposition were handed to the council alongside a petition comprising 500 signatures but they will continue with the plans - which also include a play area - in efforts to put a stop to ‘unauthorised encampments’. The £3.2million cost of the project was only revealed through a Freedom of Information request and got the go ahead yesterday by Cheshire East Council . Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its Grade-II listing was cancelled . Builder Bob Moody, 66, bought a ‘dream’ retirement cottage with his wife Trisha, 61, and has spent £130,000 renovating it with original Victorian fittings. It now lies, almost finished, at the site’s entrance but he is refusing to move into it and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market. He said: 'We’re totally gutted. We’re not going to live there now. Can we sell it? It’s going to be so hard to sell. We honestly don’t know what to do. 'Most of my life savings have gone into this cottage. Do we chop the price to half of what it was worth or do we sit on it? Would anybody want to rent it from opposite a gypsy site? 'We were so confident we were going to get somewhere in that meeting because we had strong arguments especially in regards to fire safety, as the plans put the caravans too close together which flouts regulations. Builder Bob Moody at the gates to the site with local residents Ken Roden and George Beevers. He says he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting . Mr Moody beside the house he bought in Cledford as a retirement home. He is refusing to move into the property and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market . 'If they have to be three metres apart they may have to reduce the number of caravans. That means they could be spending up to £5million to accommodate six to eight families. It’s ludicrous. 'These types of transit families in Cheshire can be obstructive, they may fight with police, defecate in hedges, leave rubbish everywhere. These are not the sort of neighbours that OAPs want opposite them.' At the planning meeting, the strategic planning board of Cheshire East Council had eight votes in favour of the site, with one against. Three members abstained from voting. Residents also raised concerns that the new site would destroy local wildlife which had settled on the site of Cledford Hall, including grass snakes, hedgehogs and toads. A planning permission sign next to Cledford Hall. Cheshire East Council say the development is needed to house travellers in the area . Mr Moody added: 'None of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside. 'There could be a minimum of between 80 and 100 gypsies and travellers at any time. Some may be very pleasant and law abiding, but you will always get the few who aren’t. 'They are only allowed to stay for 28 days so you can’t form a relationship with these people. If we get the odd ones that fight and get drunk and cause trouble it will be very intimidating.' Mr Moody explained he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting. He added: 'I’m going to talk to a lawyer to see if there is any way we can get compensation. 'It is the direct action of Cheshire East Council that has lost me nearly £100,000 and I can’t recover that cost. 'This has totally ruined my retirement and retirement plans. I haven’t set a date for my retirement now because our dream was to go to our little idyllic comfortable country cottage in the fields of Cheshire and that’s been shattered now.' Building work on the site is due to go ahead in the near future since the passing of the final stage of the application. Councillor Don Stockton, head of housing and jobs for Cheshire East Council who lives in the nearby town of Alderley Edge and was part of the applying team, said: 'We need a site somewhere in Cheshire East as we have a lot of travellers in the area and have had a lot of unapproved sites where travellers have been and we have not been able to move them. 'This is an approved site which we have investigated and compared with many others across the borough. It is very difficult to get these things sited and there has been plenty of public opposition. 'I know there has been a lot of public angst and people haven’t liked it but I’m afraid that is going to be the case wherever you would wish to put a transit site. 'I do feel sorry for the nearby residents. I think if the site was on my doorstep it’s just a case if wherever these things are sited it is bound to have opposition. 'It wouldn’t matter whether it was next to my house or anyone’s house. With the best will in the world we have to try and pick the best site possible. 'It’s just inevitable there is opposition and I’m very sorry for those who have a problem with that. We are under a legal obligation to have site for travellers.” Middlewich, which borders Cledford, was named the UK’s fourth most desirable place to live in a Royal Mail study last year.","Plans for site for travellers has been approved by East Cheshire Council .

The newspaper reported that Weber's flight experience goes back decades: he flew in both World War II and the Vietnam War, and also served as a Korean War flight instructor. All told, Guinness World Records says on its website that 'Peter has been a pilot for 72 years.' According to Guinness, Weber was a flight cadet in 1943. 'Peter went on to become a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Air Force,' the website says. 'He retired from the Air Force in 1970, and since then has flown for recreational purposes.' Weber pulled off his March 30 flight at the age of 95 years and 143 days, Guinness says.

Roy Day (right), 29, and Gerard Lundie (left), 26, targeted 13 homes over four months at the end of last year . They were each jailed for five years and four months at Birmingham Crown Court after they admitted once charge of conspiracy to commit burglary. The crime spree began on September 18 last year when a Citroen C4 and widescreen TV were stolen from a house in Calshot Road, Great Barr, Birmingham. Lundie was arrested seven days later when the stolen car was seen speeding away from officers at 100mph in Erdington, Birmingham but later let go. He was found hiding in a nearby bush after fleeing the vehicle. He admitted driving the car but denied stealing it or having any knowledge of it being stolen. Lundie was released on bail but continued to target properties in Birmingham, Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire. The duo stole a Kia car from the drive of a property in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, on October 20 which was later found abandoned. Forensic experts discovered Lundie's DNA inside the vehicle which eventually linked the pair to the crime.

43,"Lady Penelope (left) and her faithful chauffeur Aloysius Parker (right) have been given slight tweaks for the 2015 remake of Thunderbirds . FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. Thunderbirds are Go! Again! Yes, 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world, ITV is bringing it back. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by computer-generated figures. In a nod to 21st-century political correctness, there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added. Geeky scientist Brains has lost his bow tie for an open-neck shirt and has been given an Indian accent. Even Lady Penelope and her faithful chauffeur Aloysius Parker have been given slight tweaks for 2015. Lady Penelope is this time voiced by Gone Girl actress Rosamund Pike. She has also lost the twin-set and pearls and looks a much more modern, dressed down lady secret agent. Parker, meanwhile, returns with his original voice, that of 89-year-old David Graham, but has dropped his chauffeur uniform and sports a roll-neck sweater. His new look is completed by swept-back, grey-streaked hair. Thunderbirds aired here between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 50-minute episodes over two series, shown in 66 countries. The show spawned a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products, from puppets and lunchboxes to T-shirts, so much so that December 1966 was dubbed Thunderbirds Christmas. This is not, however the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was an unmitigated disaster, losing almost £20 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show’s co-creator, called it ‘the biggest load of c**p’ he had seen and rejected an offer of £400,000 for just going to the premiere. ‘Remaking something as iconic as Thunderbirds means that your feelings of excitement are mixed with apprehension because you don’t want to do anything to tarnish it,’ says Giles Ridge, the show’s executive producer. ‘We didn’t want to mess too much with Thunderbirds but needed to make it in a way that would excite 21st-century children.’ In a nod to 21st-century political correctness, there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added . As with the original, at the heart of Thunderbirds are the five gung-ho Tracy brothers, all named after real astronauts on America’s Mercury space mission in the early 1960s: Scott (Carpenter), John (Glenn), Virgil (Grissom), Gordon (Cooper) and Alan (Shephard). Their mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. Inspired by their widower billionaire father Jeff, (a stalwart of the original series but missing in this) they live on Tracy Island in the middle of the South Pacific in 2065. Lady Penelope (pictured as a puppet) has lost the twin-set and pearls and looks a much more modern, dressed down lady secret agent in the new remake . When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There are also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Main writer Rob Hoegee is in Los Angeles but watches script readings on Skype. Peter Jackson’s animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics. Despite all the new technology, the backgrounds are models, including an 18ft-high Tracy Island. Gerry Anderson and his wife Sylvia came up with Thunderbirds after a mining disaster in West Germany in 1963. On the original show everyone had to multi-task; for Sylvia that meant voicing Lady Penelope, International Rescue’s London agent. Rosamund Pike says she didn’t hesitate when she was offered the role. ‘As soon as ITV asked me,’ she says, ‘I knew it would be very exciting. ‘Lady Penelope often plays up to the frivolous elements of who she is — a girl who loves clothes, pink cars, little dogs — to blindside people and conceal what she really is up to at any given point That is usually breaking in somewhere she shouldn’t be, finding secrets in dangerous situations.’ Her car is no longer a Rolls (no brands are used in children’s television programmes now), but thankfully she still has Parker. ‘The producers met me for coffee,’ says David Graham. ‘I think they wanted to see what sort of shape I’m in, but I was thrilled to be able to recreate this character. Parker was originally just a minor character, but he eventually became Gerry’s favourite.’ Parker returns with his original voice, that of 89-year-old David Graham, but has dropped his chauffeur uniform (pictured) and now sports a roll-neck sweater with swept-back, grey-streaked hair . Parker has retained his distinctive cockney-trying-to-be-snooty accent. David says: ‘Gerry took me to lunch and said: “I want you to listen to the wine waiter.” So the waiter came over and asked if we would like to see the wine list and he just had this great accent. I’m not sure he knew we modelled the voice on him.’ There has been a concerted effort to increase the female and multicultural roles in the show to make it appeal to aspirational girls and boys of all races. Merlin actress Angel Coulby plays Kayo, an ‘adopted little sister’ to the Tracy brothers who is in charge of security for Tracy Island. Former Casualty actress Adjoa Andoh voices Colonel Casey, commanding officer of the Global Defence Force. Thunderbirds aired here between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 50-minute episodes over two series, shown in 66 countries .","Fifty years after the futuristic puppet show launched ITV is bringing it back .

The Spaniard has come through a testing first six months in English football which saw him begin the season in the team before having a reduced role as a substitute. That led to suggestions manager Louis van Gaal did not rate the £29million summer signing from Athletic Bilbao.

46,"(CNN)Standing up for what you believe. What does it cost you? What do you gain? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. ""If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,"" Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: ""Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion."" ""Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza"" tweeted Aღanda. ""Just mock them for their ignorance."" Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. ""Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!"" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  ""Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business."" Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. ""Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?"" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads ""bigots."" Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. ""Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?"" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. ""Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses,"" said a tweet from Victor Nikki. ""What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob,"" tweeted Savannah. ""Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere."" Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is ""to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith,"" according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. ""That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual,"" Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. ""You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be."" Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

47,"Fashion-conscious militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have been dealt a blow after their commanders banned them wearing products made by Nike. The sports brand features prominently on a leaflet distributed in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa warning ISIS jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear. The news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of Nike among ISIS fighters, comparing the brand's name and famous 'tick' logo to wearing a Christian cross. His comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear Nike products because they are 'comfy and good quality, unlike crosses'. Banned: The sports brand features prominently (circled) on a leaflet distributed in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa warning ISIS jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear . Not allowed: The leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of Nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonmen . Images of the leaflet banning Nike clothing was shared online by the activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who translated it from Arabic. They said Nike was singled out because of its associations with the Greek goddess of the same name and because the word apparently sounds similar to phrases of a sexual nature in Arabic. The leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of Nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonment. This is despite the fact one of the group's most famous commanders, Abu Waheeb, is well known for wearing Western sportswear, including items made by Nike and Adidas. The argument that senior ISIS militants still wear Nike products is unlikely to be considered much of a defence for the millions of brutally oppressed citizens living under the rule of the Islamic State. Fashion-conscious: The ban comes despite the fact one of the group's most famous commanders, Abu Waheeb, is well known for wearing Western sportswear, including items made by Nike and Adidas . The wearing of Nike products has long been contentious among ISIS jihadis, due to the fact the name was inspired by a Greek goddess and reportedly sound like several words of a sexual nature in Arabic . The news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of Nike among ISIS fighters, comparing the brand's famous 'tick' logo to wearing a Christian cross. His comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear Nike products because they are 'comfortable' A recent ban of men wearing jeans - apparently because the clothing 'provokes sexual desire, and shows the attractions of men's body' - has been strictly enforced. In fact some young men seen wearing jeans after the ban was put in place were reportedly told they must exchange their denim products for pyjamas, or face time in prison. As well as products made by Nike, numerous other items of clothing appear on the leaflet. Newly-banned products on the list include anything carrying swear words or sexual phrases. To help non-English speakers recognise the banned terms, the ISIS leaflet helpfully provides a long list of swear words alongside their Arabic translation. Nike did not respond to a request for comment on the ban.","Jihadis face fines, whipping or even jail time for wearing Nike products .

49,"Hong Kong (CNN)An impressive art collection assembled by the late actress and Hollywood icon, Lauren Bacall, has officially been offered for purchase. The collection, which includes works by some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, went under the hammer in New York on March 31, following a tour of Hong Kong, Paris, London and Los Angeles. Bacall, who died in August 2014 at the age of 89, first shot to international fame in 1944 with her first film, ""To Have And Have Not."" That was also when the husky-voiced starlet met her future husband, Humphrey Bogart. At the recent 2015 Golden Globes, George Clooney paid tribute to the silver screen queen in his award winning speech. ""I don't remember what awards Lauren Bacall won, I just remember her saying: 'You know how to whistle, don't you Steve. You just put your lips together and blow.'"" said Clooney, referring to one of her most legendary lines from her first movie. The 750-piece collection, which fetched a total of $3.64 million, featured bronze sculptures, jewelry, and a number of decorative arts and paintings, which were sold at Bonhams auction house in New York. ""Her collection is truly a reflection of her extraordinary taste and remarkable life,"" said Jon King, Bonhams' vice president. Among the 50 items highlighted in the auction preview were six bronze maquettes by Henry Moore, Britain's greatest 20th century sculptor and one of Bacall's favorite artists, whom she developed a close relationship with. One of them sold for close to $120,000. Also for sale were some of Bacall's most loved jewelry pieces, created by legendary French designer Jean Schlumberger, most known for his work at Tiffany & Co. A rose diamond camel brooch by British jeweler Elizabeth Gage fetched $23,750 and was accompanied by the original drawing and correspondence from the designer, which shows the close-knit relationship Bacall had with Gage. The wide-ranging collection was expected to appeal to a variety of collectors: fine arts and antiques dealers, fans of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, as well as memorabilia enthusiasts. Most of the items auctioned come from the apartment in New York's Dakota Building that she shared with her second husband, actor Jason Robards, until 1969. But King said fans of Humphrey Bogart would have been pleased to know some of the items were also from their shared residence in Los Angeles. King, who got to know Bacall in her late years, said the collection reflects the actress' eclectic taste, and there was only one principle she applied to collecting: . ""Everything had to kind of speak to her, to catch her eye. She loved form, she loved texture, she loved color. And she loved mixing it all up. She said that when you walked into her house, what she liked was that it was never boring,"" King said. ""You could walk into the same room a hundred times, and see something new every time.""","A collection of 750 items belonging to legendary actress Lauren Bacall has been auctioned off at Bonhams in New York .

50,"A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.","Andrew Steele, 40, claims that the terminal disease affected his brain .

The South Africa-based businessman ousted the previous directors last month and plans a return to the Ibrox boardroom if he can overcome SFA obstacles. King has delayed the process of nominating himself as chairman until he can persuade the governing body's Professional Game Board that 41 convictions under South African tax law are not a breach of SFA regulations. Dave King (centre) will have to convince the SFA that he is suitable to become the next Rangers chairman . He also faces questions about his role as a club director when the oldco Ibrox outfit plunged into liquidation in the summer of 2012.

Refusing to put a timescale on when a decision will come, Regan said: 'We are in discussions with Rangers and their advisors and we are gathering information on Mr King. When we have all of that information in, the board will consider it and decide whether or not we are prepared to accept Dave King as a fit and proper person to be chairman of Rangers. We are not in a position to put a timescale on that. 'We need any evidence from Mr King that would support why he believes that he is fit and proper in consideration to the list of criteria in our Article 10 which cover all of the areas regarding track record, background, insolvency and any convictions. 'His tax convictions are a challenge for him and the club to try and present a case whereby the board can view it positively.' King's ally Paul Murray, serving as interim chairman, faces his own fit and proper scrutiny under Article 10. SFA chief Stewart Regan says that King must give evidence to support his case to be chairman at Ibrox . 'Paul Murray, equally, is being considered given that he was a director of a football club that has been in an insolvency event in the last five years,' added Regan. King received clearance from the Court of Session to return to the boardroom after serving as a director in the Ibrox oldco and hopes that will help the SFA to reach a decision in his favour.

Two Atlanta Hawks players, Pero Antić and Thabo Sefolosha, were also arrested 'for obstructing police when they arrived'
All three victims are in stable condition in hospital .
Copeland is in town to play his former team, the  Knicks, tonight ."
53,"The world’s first cloned camel is pregnant, scientists claim. The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born from a  surrogate mother. Injaz was six years old this week and is said to have conceived naturally. The world’s first cloned camel is pregnant, scientists claim. The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother. Injaz is pictured here when she was just six days old . Dr Nisar Wani, scientific director of the Reproductive Biotechnology Centre in Nad Al Sheba, Dubai, told The National: ‘We are very excited because Injaz is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year. ‘She has conceived in a natural way. This will prove cloned camels are fertile and can reproduce the same as naturally produced camels.’ The birth of Injaz, whose name means 'achievement' in Arabic, caused great excitement in 2009 and scientists said that cloning would help to preserve the genetics of the camel population. Camels are a valuable commodity in the desert sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf, and are used for racing and transport. They can also produce low-fat milk and can make owners millions of dollars at camel beauty contests. Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner. It's 19 years since the first mammal was cloned. Dolly the sheep (pictured) was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell . Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner, the BBC reported. It took five years of work before Injaz was cloned. She was born on April 8, 2009 weighing 66lbs (30kg), after an uncomplicated gestation of 378 days. The calf was created from cells harvested from the ovary of an adult camel. The cells were then planted into the egg of a surrogate mother. Injaz was confirmed as genetically identical to the camel the cells were taken from, according to United Arab Emirates newspapers at the time. The world's first mammal was cloned 19 years ago. Dolly the sheep was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell. Dolly was put down in 2003, after being diagnosed with lung disease, but since then, scientists have successfully cloned mice, cows, pigs and dogs as well as camels. Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos.","Cloned camel was born in 2009 and called Inzaz, which means achievement .

54,"Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'","Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .
