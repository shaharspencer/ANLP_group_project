In this paper we propose a routing algorithm for publish-subscribe (pub/sub) systems. The goal of the routing algorithm is to deliver a publication with a minimum number of messages to all subscribers. The routing strategy is based on a Steiner tree, which is computationally too expensive and requires at least as many messages as nodes in the virtual ring. In this paper we consider scenarios where nodes frequently change their subscriptions, hence, an efficient update of the routing structure is required. To meet this goal we propose the routing algorithm PSVR, which is self-stabilizing. The proposed
In this paper, we propose a checkpointing scheme for clustering routing protocol as a method of improving reliability. In this scheme, a cluster head takes a tentative checkpoint and later on when it receives commit request from the initiator, MH converts its tentative checkpoint into permanent checkpoint. The checkpointing scheme is based on the principle of minimum process checkpointing. The checkpointing scheme is based on the principle of minimum process checkpoint. The checkpointing scheme is based on the principle of minimum process checkpoint. The proposed checkpointing scheme is based on the principle of
Unlike car traffic, railway operations have technical frameworks to constantly enforce strict safety procedures. These frameworks include the constant upkeep of “safe blocks” (to prevent collisions even in case when one of the trains comes to an unexpected stop or derails), emergency braking if a red signal is passed, detection of train decomposition, and variable speed control. Despite advances in conventional and AI-supported decision making, a lot of this work is still performed by humans, i.e. experienced dispatchers. Despite attempts at standardization, both interoperability and vendor lock in
Content-based Publish/Subscribe (CPS) systems are used for many–to–many communication among loosely coupled distributed entities. A publisher publishes data in form of notifications, while a subscriber registers its interest in form of a subscription (set of filters or predicates). A subscription is broad cast in the overlay network and saved in routing table of each broker in order to form a subscription–tree. A subscription is then used to route notifications using content-based routing using Reverse Path Forwarding. However, acyclic overlay topology provides only one routing path
An overlay network is a network created on top of an existing network. It is a network whose links are realised as flows (or connections) of the underlying network. It is used to improve the reliability of largescale distributed systems in the presence of partial network failures. In this paper, we propose a new approach to resiliency in large-scale distributed systems. We consider two scenarios: 1) routing in a distributed cloud, and 2) routing in a distributed cloud. In the first case, we consider the shortest-hop metric. In this paper, we propose a new
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used in the interdomain network for exchange of routing information between autonomous systems (ASes). In the interdomain network, each AS selects the best route according to its routing policies and announces the selected route to neighbors. However, due to misconfiguration and malicious attacks, the routing announcement may be propagated in violation of their agreed routing policy, which is defined as route leak. In this paper, we propose a method to detect route leaks using a blockchain-based federated learning framework. We propose a method to
NetworksonChips (NoCs) have become the mainstream intrachip communication infrastructure for CMPs and many core systems due to their scalability and power efficiency. The communication in NoCs can be categorized into unicast (one-to-one) and multicast (one-to-many) communication. Multicast traffic is demonstrated in parallel applications involving multithreaded programs, replication, barrier/clock synchronization, and cache coherence protocols. Simulations of a set of CMP benchmark applications show that the multicast traffic per centage ranges from 5%
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems are intractable to solve optimally at large scales. Among them, the 2D Euclidean Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) has been the most intensely studied NP-hard graph problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learning large-scale TSP via reinforcement learning. We compare three identical autoregressive GNN-based models trained on 12.8 Million TSP200 instances via reinforcement learning. We show that learning efficiently from trivial TSP200 nodes is in terms of both sample efficiency and wall clock time
Anonymous communication networks (ACNs) are overlay networks consisting of a set of dedicated routers, also called relays, that are connected via the Internet. The goal of ACNs is to anonymize communications by relaying them over multiple routers. There are three main types of anonymous routing in terms of how routers are chosen to form the path. First, in deterministic routing, the paths are predetermined by the system configuration. Second, in source routing, the full path is chosen by the initiator of the communication. In this paper, we propose multiparty routing

OCEAN is based on direct observations of the nodes' exchanges with each other. OCEAN eliminates most of the complexity and provides nodes'

In this paper, we propose a novel load balancing scheme for vehicular-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in mesh networks (MANETs). The proposed scheme uses a simple packet distribution scheme to distribute data traffic over multiple suboptimal routing paths. The proposed scheme is based on the objective modular network testbed in C++ (OMNeT++) and its IN ETMANET framework. The proposed scheme is based on a simple packet distribution scheme, which is based on the mobility prediction of the route.
Routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and other Internet of Things (IoT) instances is still a very active area of research. While well-established routing protocols exist for IP networks, routing in MANETs and other IoT instances, such as networks of cars, unmanned vehicles, or collectives of vehicles and humans, is still a very active area of research. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the performance of routing protocols in MANETs, based on the results in the following:
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a strong architecture for creating scalable and efficient smart city networks. However, no holistic NDN of Things (NDNoT) architecture and protocol suite has yet been proposed. In particular, existing works tend to neglect concerns related to secure routing and onboarding, two of the most difficult problems in IoT. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework for Lightweight Authentication & Secured Routing (LASeR), a holistic framework for efficient and secure onboarding and routing in the NDNDN. We demonstrate LASeR'
Mobile robotic networks are an important subset of mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) and form a class for a wide range of different network types. The provision of reliable end-to-end communication in this kind of networks is a challenging topic due to the high relative mobility. Existing routing protocols can barely cope with the frequently changing network and fail to adopt to the new channel and topology conditions. In this paper, we combine two different perspectives: a mobilitycentric view and a routing centric view to enhance the overall routing performance and the stability of communication paths. We present the results of

In this paper we propose a delay aware routing protocol for wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is a routing solution for the transmission of time critical event information to the Sink or Base Station within a deadline. It also ensures reliability by following multipath routing so that at least one copy of the event information is received by the Sink or Base Stations. The proposed protocol is designed for the application of typical WSNs where certain time critical events required to be detected and to be informed to the Sink within a certain delay limit with reliability. The proposed protocol is designed for the application of
Circuit routing is a challenging and computationally expensive problem. It is usually solved in two stages: first global routing and then detailed routing. However, the two stages do not always couple well. For example, it is difficult for the wire density in global routing result to match the routability of the down stream detailed router. Hence, a low-congestion global routing result may lead to subsequent detail routing difficult. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end routing approach that does not require domain knowledge nor specialized heuristics. We use a deep neural network (D
We study a caching network, i.e., a network of nodes augmented with additional storage capabilities. In such a network, some nodes act as designated content servers, permanently storing content and serving as caches of last resort'. Other nodes generate requests for content that are forwarded towards these designated servers. If, however, an intermediate node in the path towards a server stores the requested content, the request is satis ed early: i.e., the request is forwarded towards the nearest designated server. It is not a

The growth of the Internet infrastructure has led to much debate as to whether it is architecturally unable to scale. This has led to the development of several competing solutions, including the Locator/Identity Separation Protocol (LISP). In this paper we analyze the scalability of the LISP edge cache with respect to the growth of the Internet and the growth of the LISP site. We find that the cache size scales constantly O(1) with respect to the growth of the Internet and the number of users, if the popularity distribution follows a GeneralizedZipf distribution of destination pre-x

In this case, the forwarding algorithm relies on two aspects: information about the nodes’
Deep learning (DL) has become increasingly prevalent, and there is naturally a growing need for understanding DL predictions in many decisionmaking area, such as healthcare diagnosis and public policymaking. However, it is always challenging to explain a timeseries prediction due to the nature of temporal dependency and varying patterns over time. On the other hand, many existing explanation methods are based on assigning importance scores to different parts of the input to explain the prediction. However, they do not provide actionable counterfactual explanations on how to modify the current model input

The Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is one of the important on demand routing protocols in MANET. The proactive routing protocol is the extension of the protocols in wired network. The proactive routing protocol is maintained in each node and the information of the routes to every other node is updated periodically.

Eco routing is a promising technique for reducing fuel consumption. However, the fuel consumption model for eco routing is not robust enough to address heterogeneity in driving. Several mesoscopic models have been studied, but they are not accurate enough due to complexity of traffic scenario and nonlinearity of vehicle powertrains.

In this regard, we propose a reroute package pickup and delivery planning with stochastic demand (Reroute PDPSD) system. The Reroute PDPSD system aims to help the shipper to (i) plan trucks’ routing given that customers’ package sizes ar e random, (ii) decide whether to accommodate the new requests, and (iiiiii

As AWN is completely unambiguous, it enforces to tal precision and the removal of any ambiguities. A key contribution is to demonstrate how AWN can be used to support reasoning about protocol correctness

Geographic routing protocols are fast coming up in the arena of Wireless Ad hoc and Sensor Networks (WASN) for obvious reasons. Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) are another area where geographic routing protocols find their application. In such scenarios, the nodes in the network need to have a sound reserve of residual energy. One way to reduce the energy consumption of the network is to reduce the frequency of packet transmission with out compromising the reliability. This can be done by waiting for a considerable number of short transmissions to arrive first. But this approach is sure to reduce the delay experienced in
In this paper, we study the impact of shortest path routing in a large multi-hop wireless network. We show that, when using geographic routing, 25% of the messages are relayed by the nodes in a small central congested region whose area is 3% of the total area of the square. This is bad for a number of reasons. First, it induces congested areas in the network, where the nodes have to relay much more messages than the other nodes in the network. Secondly, if the nodes are selfish, then there is node in the
Offchain networks (or payment channel networks) are emerging as one of the most promising solutions to solve the scaling challenge of blockchain. They allow two participants to make multiple payments with each other, without the need to commit every transaction to the blockchain. As a result, offchain networks have the potential to significantly improve the transaction throughput and reduce the transaction latency of blockchain. However, routing is critical for offchain networks to fulfill their promise. Efficient routing can successfully deliver most payments in an offchain network, minimizing the operations on the blockchain.
