In this paper we propose a new routing algorithm for publish-subscribe (pub/sub) systems. The proposed algorithm is based on a self-stabilizing tree-based approach that enables the publication of messages to subscribers without requiring any routing tables. The proposed algorithm is based on the idea of a virtual ring, which is a recursive tree-based routing structure. The virtual ring is a ring of nodes that is recursively forwarded messages around. The virtual ring is a virtual ring of nodes. The proposed algorithm is self
In this paper, we propose a checkpointing scheme for clustering routing protocol as a method of improving reliability. In ad hoc wireless networks, a cluster head is the node that is given the responsibility for routing the messages within the cluster and performing the data aggregation. In this case, the node depends on other nodes to relay packets if they do not have direct links. In this case, a checkpointing scheme is proposed in which a checkpointing scheme is proposed in which a checkpointing scheme is formulated in which a checkpointing
Dispatching and safety are fundamental to railway operations. However, the principles of train control remain largely the same: the control center is “the master” and the train is “the slave”. This resembles the mainframe design patterns, where the control center is “the master” and the train is “the slave”. However, there are situations where seamless train to infrastructure and train to train contracting could lead to improvements: trains could dynamically negotiate and “sell” a timeslot, automating re-dispatching in a
This paper presents a cyclic overlay topology for content-based publish/subscribe (CPS) systems. The cyclic overlay topology is a purpose-built topology generated from Cartesian product of graphs. The topology is based on a purpose-built topology called Structured Cyclic Overlay Topology (SCOT). OctopiS exploits the structuredness of SCOT to generate subscription-trees of shortest lengths and do not require unique identifications to avoid loops. The system is scalable for large network settings.
An overlay network is a network created on top of an existing network, the links of which are realised as flows (or connections) of the underlying network. It is used to improve the reliability of large-scale distributed systems in the presence of partial network failures. This is the main application of overlay networks, and we focus on the reliability of the overlay network in the presence of partial network failures. We consider the use of overlay networks in a distributed cloud, where the routing protocol is implemented over a dense virtual mesh of links, and the overlay network
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used in the interdomain network for exchange of routing information between autonomous systems (ASes). In the interdomain network, each AS selects the best route according to its routing policies and announces the selected route to neighbors. However, due to misconfiguration and malicious attacks, the routing announcement may be propagated in violation of their agreed routing policy, which is defined as route leak. In this paper, we propose a method to detect route leaks using a blockchain-based federated learning framework. The proposed method uses a distributed machine learning framework to collect model updates
NetworksonChips (NoCs) have become the mainstream intrachip communication infrastructure for CMPs and many core systems due to their scalability and power efficiency. The communication in NoCs can be categorized into unicast (one-to-one) and multicast (one-many) communication. A significant amount of multicast traffic is demonstrated in parallel applications involving multithreaded programs, replication, barrier/clock synchronization, and cache coherence protocols. Simulations of a set of benchmark applications with MESI cache protocols
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems are intractable to solve optimally at large scales. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown competitive performance with OR solvers on trivially small problem instances up to few hundreds of nodes. However, once trained, GNN-based approximate solvers have significantly favorable time complexity, making them highly desirable for real-world decision-making problems such as TSP and associated class of Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this paper, we present a simple non-lear
Anonymous communication networks (ACNs) are overlay networks consisting of a set of dedicated routers, also called relays, that are connected via the Internet. The goal of ACNs is to anonymize communications by relaying them over multiple routers. There are three main types of anonymous routing: source routing, hopbyhop routing, and multiparty routing. In this paper, we propose multiparty routing, a novel type of anonymous routing that broadens the design space with a multiparty computation technique. In addition to anonymity, we provide a
Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a group of wireless mobile computers (or nodes) which cooperate by forwarding packets for each other to allow them to communicate beyond direct wireless transmission range. The cooperation among the nodes is not guaranteed in a real world network and the presence of misbehaving nodes could degrade the network performance significantly. In this paper, OCEAN (Observation based Cooperation Enforcement in Ad hoc Network) was used in forbidding all kinds of indirect reputation information.
Internet of Things (IoT) is a new era of distributed computing environment with a large number of smart objects that are capable of producing and consuming highly dynamic information. The IoT is a complex environment consisting of much heterogeneous hardware as well as software components. The IoT is a highly dynamic distributed networked system with a large number of smart objects that are capable of producing and consuming highly dynamic information. The IoT is a highly dynamic distributed networked system with a large number of smart objects
MANET routing protocols are a promising candidate for finding reliable communication paths between sender and destination. However, most current mesh routing protocols focus on the determination of a single optimal communication path between sender and destination. High data traffic demands lead to an intense usage of those paths, decreasing the Quality of Service (QoS)capabilities of the applications due to packet collisions and congestion. In this paper, we propose a simple packet distribution scheme to achieve load balancing in the context of V2V communication. The general idea is that spreading data traffic over multiple suboptimal routing paths will lead to
Routing is a fundamental function of any network, as it allows data to flow across the network and reach its destination. In the context of delay-tolerant networks (DTNs), routing is NP-hard due to the sparsity and mobility of the nodes, which results in relatively low data delivery probabilities (also called delivery rates, or delivery rates). In this paper, we propose a novel NP-hard routing algorithm for delay-tolerant networks (DTNs), which is based on the heuristic "store and forward" replication-based "store and
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising architecture for scalability and security in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, existing works tend to neglect concerns related to secure routing and onboarding, two of the most difficult problems in IoT. In this paper, we propose a scalable and secure framework for onboarding and routing in the NDNoT. We combine our approaches to authentication and onboarding into a single holistic framework for Lightweight Authentication & Secured Routing (LASeR). The combined authentication and onboarding process requires only three round trips
Mobile robotic networks are an important subset of mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) and form a class for a wide range of different network types. The provision of reliable end-to-end communication in this kind of networks is a challenging topic due to the high relative mobility. Established routing protocols can barely cope with the frequently changing network and fail to adopt to the new channel and topology conditions. In this paper, we combine these approaches to enhance the overall routing performance and the stabil ity of communication paths in low altitude UA V networks. Application layer mobility control data is used to predict future
Routing Protocol (RPL) is a distance based proactive protocol used for routing in Low Power Lossy Networks (LLN). RPL is a distance based proactive protocol which is susceptible from various attacks. These attacks are possible due to the problem of unauthenticated or unencrypted control frames, centralized root controller, compromised and unauthenticated devices and many more ways. In this paper, we propose a new RPL-based routing protocol called a Distance Oriented Directed AcyclicGraph (DIO) which is used for routing.
Routing protocols are designed to calculate paths for communication networks. In proactive protocols, periodic exchange of contr ol messages and maintains routing tables. In reactive protocols, tries to discover a route only when demand arrives. Our simulation work based upon three protocols comparison in MANETs and in VANETs named as AODV, DSR and FSR. Moreover, we introduce some modifications in their routing exchange intervals; 1) in MOD AODV, augments AODV’s Expanding Ring Search algorithm (ERS)
In this paper we propose a delay aware routing protocol for wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is a routing solution for the transmission of time critical event information to the Sink or Base Station within a deadline. The proposed protocol also ensures reliability by following multipath routing so that at least one copy of the event information is received by the Sink or Base Station within a deadline. The proposed protocol is designed for the application of typical WSNs where certain time critical events required to be detected and to be informed to the Sink within a certain delay limit with reliability by following multipath routing
Circuit routing is a computationally expensive and challenging problem. It is usually solved in two stages: first global routing and then detailed routing. However, the two stages do not always couple well. For example, it is difficult for the wire density in global routing result to match the routability of the down stream detailed routing. Moreover, routing algorithms are dominantly manually crafted based on domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a general Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm that solves circuit routing by using a deep neural network that embeds the routing state. We
We study a caching network, i.e., a network of nodes augmented with additional storage capabilities. In such a network, some nodes act as designated content servers, permanently storing content and serving as caches of last resort'. Other nodes generate requests for content that are forwarded towards these designated servers. If, however, an intermediate node in the path towards a server stores the requested content, the request is satisfied early: i.e., the request ceases to be forwarded
In this paper, we present Temporal Dynamics in Anonymity Systems: A Set of Attacks that Demonstrate the Impact of Temporal Dynamics on the Security of several popular anonymity protocols. We target Tor and some of the latest proposals for improving its security against network-level adversaries, such as Autonomous Systems (ASes). We also target proposals for network-layer anonymity that represent the main ideas for providing anonymity against ASes in a next-generation Internet. We consider especially a patient adversary that is interested in performing long-term attacks on anonymity path changes
BorderGatewayProtocol (BGP) is a Path Vector Routing protocol, in which routers repeatedly advertise 'better' routes (along with their path tails) to their immediate neighbors. In the context of adhoc wireless networks, a node with several forwarders in its vicinity must first establish the identity of every such forwarder who is also a forwarder, and then broadcast as many updates. In this paper, we propose a protocol for wireless routing, which is based on a public key. The public key of the signature scheme is uniquely determined via
Qrouting is a class of adaptive routing policies which uses the learning framework of Qlearning to solve the routing problem in NoCs as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Qrouting is a model free learning algorithm for solving RL problems. It is model free because it does not require a model of the environment to learn a policy. In RL, an agent learns to maximize the return, or long-term reward, over a sequence of actions in an environment. In Qrouting, the agent has a representation of the current environment. The cost function defines a path
Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) semantically separates identity from location by creating two separate namespaces that unambiguously address endhosts (identities) and their Internet attachment points (locators). LISP is a scalable solution that relies on a cache to store information about the end-users and their Internet attachment points. However, LISP requires a large number of bindings to be registered, distributed and retrieved, which is a significant overhead for the current infrastructure. To address this issue, we propose a cache model that scales
Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has been proposed to facilitate high data rate transmissions among near users in cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid control-data plane architecture for D2D networks, based on a centralized control plane and a distributed data plan. In this case, the base station controls the forwarding policy while the data is transmitted from device-to-device until it reaches the destination. The forwarding algorithm is based on the information about the nodes’ centrality and the static social communities. The community detection algorithms are computational
Deep learning (DL) has become increasingly prevalent, and there is naturally a growing need for understanding DL predictions in many decision-making area. However, understanding the contribution of different input parts to explain model predictions is usually not sufficiently informative for decision making: people often want to know what changes made to the input could have led to a specific (desirable) prediction. However, understanding the contribution of different input parts are usually not sufficiently informative for decision making: people often want to know what changes made to the input could have led to a specific (target) prediction. However, they often
Wire less-HART is a real-time wireless sensor network that is best suited for industrial process control systems due to its reliable TDMA based schedule, multi-channel support, channel hopping, redundancy in routes, and avoidance of spatial reuse of channels. The deterministic schedule in a Wire less-HART network is repeated over every hyperperiod, making these systems vulnerable to timing attacks. The repetitive execution of the deterministic schedule in a Wire less-HART network makes these systems vulnerable to timing attacks.
The routing protocols are classified into two categories - proactive (Table Driven) routing protocols and reactive (On Demand) routing protocols. The proactive protocol is the extension of the protocols in wired network. In this case, a routing table is established in each node and this information is updated periodically. The periodic propagation of routing information increases the network overhead. A reactive protocol on the other hand finds the route only when it needs to send some data. This on demand characteristics is the major advantage of reactive protocol. The present paper studies the Adhoc On demand routing protocol. The
This paper presents a non-parametric data driven fuel consumption model based on real world driving data and Autonomie fuel consumption simulation model. The model is based on a Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) model, which is a non-parametric model based on a Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) model. The model is invariant under any coordinate system, thus the model is invariant under any coordinate system. The fuel consumption model is then used to evaluate the fuel consumption of different routing strategies. The model is invariant
In this paper, we consider the reroute planning of a shipper. In this scenario, the customers can request for package pickup and delivery anytime. The shipper first decides whether to accept or reject the requests given available trucks. If the request is accepted, the shipper has to decide how to utilize and reroute the trucks that might be already serving other customers to accommodate the new request. If the request is rejected, the shipper will outsource the delivery to a third-party carrier which typically incurs a higher cost. To achieve an efficient solution for the shipper, we propose re
Free space optics (FSO) is a technique for transmitting data via the atmosphere. It is a relatively new technology that has been used in sensor networks for several years. However, it is still a relatively new technology in the field of sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel free space optics (FSO)-based wireless multimedia sensor network which consists of sensor nodes that can communicate via FSO or RF. The proposed FSO-based sensor network is based on a simple baseband analog and digital circuitry.
MANET is a wireless network without a central administration. Its open design makes it vulnerable to attacks. Attacks might target the network while data or packets are transferred or by monitoring network activity. This paper presents a blockchain based, management secure, QoS enhanced MANET. SRA with blockchain enables network security by producing hash codes for each transaction and authenticating each node that joins the network.

Maximum Profit Pickup Routing Problem (MPRP) is a generalization of the strongly NPhard Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), making MPRP, MPRPM, and MPRPMVS also strongly NPhard by extension. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for MPRP, which works under certain assumptions about the problem input parameters such as time windows and spatial distribution of the input sites around the depot. The algorithm is based on the assumption that the input sites are distributed in a random manner around the depot. The algorithm is randomized algorithm is randomized algorithm for

Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) are a subclass of Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs). In this paper, we propose a position-based routing protocol in urban scenarios that uses the learning algorithm for decreasing the communication overhead and the number of hops. Furthermore, this protocol uses the traffic information for enhancing learning. In addition, the proposed protocol uses the location service to gain the current position of the destination node. In addition, the proposed protocol uses the location service to gain the current position of the
This paper presents a formal specification of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. The AODV protocol is one of the most popular protocols in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). The specification is based on the IETF RFC 3561, which contains ambiguities and contradictions. This can lead to significant differences in implementations of the AODV protocol, such as routing loops. We propose a formal specification language called AWN to support reasoning about protocol behaviour. AWN provides
The IP traffic matrix is a key parameter in network operation and management, determining the amount of traffic transferred per second between any ingressegress pair of routers. It is not readily available in legacy IP networks, as measuring all flows directly is not practical, as it requires a signifi cant amount of monitoring equipment and network wide configuration efforts. Therefore, the traffic matrix is usually estimated or sampled, both leading to inaccurate results that may adversely impact network operations due to faulty configurations based on uncertain traffic statistics. The estimation of the traffic matrix
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a powerful and influential factor in a wide range of applications. The main purposes of WSNs are to monitor, analyze, combine and respond to the data which are gathered by hundreds or thousands of sensors which are distributed in a sensing field. The main purpose of WSNs lies in the capability of deploying significant numbers of tiny nodes which have been configured by themselves. In this paper, (ECQSR) protocol proposes; Efficient Energy, Cost Reduction, and QoS based routing protocol for WSNs.
In this paper we have analysed the performance of AODV DSR and GPSR routing protocols on CBR connection pattern with different pause time, speed time also different network parameters and different measured performance metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio, Packet Loss, Throughput and End-to-End Delay. We have selected two reactive routing protocols i.e. AODV and DSR and one position based routing protocol i.e. GPSR for simulation purpose analysis. We have compared the performance of these three routing protocols with different measured performance metrics such as Packe
Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols provide a way for two parties, a sender, Alice, and a receiver, Bob, to share an unconditionally secure key in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. The best-known QKD protocols are the Bennett Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol and the six-state protocol. The two parties then carry out an information reconciliation (IR) protocol to share the same bit sequence, and then conduct a privacy amplification (PA) protocol to obtain the final secure key. In addition to the security, the key rates
The need for interdomain quality of service (QoS) is becoming more urgent than ever. The need for interdomain QoS is driven by the emerging applications (e.g., metaverse, live 3Dvideo for sports and entertainment events, remote in-teractive operations) and the need for interdomain QoS is becoming more urgent than ever. The question is why the service providers are not motivated to provide interdomain services and QoS before? The answer is that the service providers or domains are invisible from end host’s perspective and thus they cannot be held accountable even if they
Geographic routing protocols are fast coming up in the arena of Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networks (WASN) for obvious reasons. In this paper we propose a new energy efficient routing protocol that works on the principle of Fermat point. The Fermat point is a geometrical principle that is used to find the minimum distance traveled by a packet. The Fermat point is a geometrical principle that is used to find the minimum distance traveled by a packet. The Fermat point is a geometrical principle that is used to find the minimum distance traveled by a particular source node to the vertex of
Multi-hop wireless networks have an important functionality that is the possibility to use other nodes as relays in order to deliver messages and data from sources to destinations. This functionality makes multi-hop wireless networks not only scalable but also usable in various areas and contexts. Many research works have been devoted to finding energy-efficient routing protocols for this kind of networks. Often, these protocols tend to find an approximation of the shortest path between the source and the destination of the message. In this paper, we show that shortest path routing in a large congested area, where the no
Offchain networks (or payment channel networks) are a promising solution to scale blockchain. They allow two participants to make multiple payments with each other, without the need to commit every transaction to the blockchain. However, they are more dynamic than computer networks, as the initial balance of a payment channel changes after each payment. As a result, routing is critical for offchain networks to fulfill their promise. While routing is a well-studied problem in computer networking, there is a key difference between an offchain network and a computer network. In an offchain
Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a network that is formed by a group of mobile devices that are able to detect the presence of other nodes in the network. The network is able to exchange data with other nodes in the network by using a single radio signal. The routing protocol used in MANET is called Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). DSR requires no periodic packets of any kind at any level within the network. This entirely on demand behaviour allows the number of overhead packets caused by DSR to scale down to only that is needed to
Multihop wireless mesh networks have been around for decades, but their adoption has remained modest over the last couple of decades despite substantial R&D. Recent trends are contributing to growth in the adoption of these networks. In this paper, we address the gaps in goodput efficiency, reliability, latency, and tolerance to external as well as internal interference. We propose a routing protocol that can quickly establish high goodput efficiency routes, even as the networks scale in size, in the presence of limited network density and/or network dynamics—whether due to nodes. We propose a routing protocol that can be
In this paper, we propose a new on-demand routing protocol based on the idea of using UA Vs as full members belonging to existing V ANETs on the ground and assisting vehicles during the routing process. This proposal is designed for urban cities and is essentially based on the idea of using UA Vs as full members belonging to existing V ANETs on the ground and assisting vehicles during the routing process. A set of techniques is adopted during the discovery process, which aims to reduce the delay of delivery and minimize the routing overhead.
Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems are self-driving vehicles that are used to transport passengers in a one-way vehicle-sharing fashion. These systems are designed to carry passengers from their origins to their destinations, potentially in an intermodal fashion, and to rebalance empty vehicles to new requests. AMoD systems can be controlled by a central operator simultaneously computing routes for customer-carrying vehicles and rebalancing routes for empty vehicles, thus enabling a system-optimal operation of this transportation system. We propose a
