In channel-based pub/sub systems, publishers assign each message to one of several channels which are known by all nodes. Subscribers express interest in one or more channels (a.k.a. subscribing to the channel) and only receive messages as signed to these channels. The efficiency of message dissemination depends on the used routing strategy. The goal is to deliver each publication with a minimum number of messages to all subscribers. The minimum number of messages is used when the publication is routed along the Steiner tree for the publishing node and all nodes. The
In this paper, we propose a checkpointing scheme for clustering routing protocol as a method of improving reliability. A checkpointing scheme is formulated for clustering routing protocol. The checkpointing scheme is based on a minimum process checkpointing algorithm. The checkpointing scheme is formulated in a way that a cluster head takes a tentative checkpoint and later on when it receives commit request from the initiator, it converts its tentative checkpoint into permanent checkpoint. The checkpointing scheme is implemented in a way that a cluster head
Despite advances in AI-based decision-making, a lot of this work is still performed by humans, i.e. experienced dispatchers. Despite advances in conventional and AI-supported decision-making, a lot of this work is still performed by humans, i.e. experienced dispatchers. Despite advances in AI-based decision-making, the principles of railway operations remain largely the same: control center is “the master” and the train is “the slave”. This resembles the mainframe design patterns, where the trains are only the
This paper introduces OctopiS, a subscription-based publish/subscribe system that offers inter-cluster dynamic routing. OctopiS exploits a purpose-built topology called Structured Cyclic Overlay Topology (SCOT) to generate subscription-trees of shortest lengths and do not require unique identifications to detect loops. The system exploits the structuredness to generate subscription-trees of shortest lengths and do not require updates in routing tables. The system is based on a purpose-built topology called Structured Cyc
An overlay network is a network created on top of an existing network, the links of which are realised as flows (or connections) of the underlying network. It is used to improve the reliability of large-scale distributed systems in the presence of partial network failures. It is this last application that concerns us here. Overlay networks are used to improve the reliability of large-scale distributed systems in the presence of partial network failures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the reliability of large-scale distributed systems in the presence of temporary network failures.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used in the interdomain network for exchange of routing information between autonomous systems (ASes). In the interdomain network, each AS selects the best route according to its routing policies and announces the selected route to neighbors. However, due to misconfiguration and malicious attacks, the routing announcement may be propagated in violation of their agreed routing policy, which is defined as route leak. In order to detect route leaks, some studies focus on inferring AS business relationship, which is difficult to be utilized due to the lack of a ground truth. In this paper, we
NetworksonChips (NoCs) have become the mainstream intrachip communication infrastructure for CMPs and many core systems due to their scalability and power efficiency. The communication in NoCs can be categorized into unicast (onetoone) and multicast (onetomany) communication. A significant amount of multicast traffic is demonstrated in parallel applications involving multithreaded programs, replication, barrier/clock synchronization, and cache coherence protocols. Simulations of a set of CMP benchmark applications show that the multicast traffic
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems are intractable to solve optimally at large scales. In practice, the Concorde TSP solver uses linear programming with carefully handcrafted heuristics to find solutions up to tens of thousands of nodes, but with prohibitive execution times. An alternative approach by the Machine Learning community is to develop generic learning algorithms which can be trained to solve any combinatorial problem directly from problem instances themselves. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly favorable time complexity than their OR counterparts, making them highly desirable for real-time decision
Anonymous communication networks (ACNs) are overlay networks consisting of a set of dedicated routers, also called relays, that are connected via the Internet. The goal of ACNs is to anonymize communications by relaying them over multiple routers. There are three main types of anonymous routing in terms of how routers are chosen to form the path. First, in deterministic routing, the paths are predetermined by the system configuration. Second, in hopbyhop routing, the full path is chosen by the initiator of the communication. In this paper, we propose multiparty routing
Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are wireless networks in which nodes cooperate by forwarding packets for each other to allow them to communicate beyond direct wireless transmission range. These networks are highly vulnerable to several types of attacks, due to their open medium, lack of centralized monitoring, management point, and lack of strong line of defense. In this paper, we propose OCEAN (Observation based Cooperation Enforcement in Ad hoc Network) to prevent misbehavior in MANETs. OCEAN is a protocol that allows node to make routing decisions based on direct

MANET routing protocols are a promising candidate for finding reliable communication paths between sender and destination. However, most current mesh routing protocols focus on the determination of a single optimal communication path between sender and destination. High data traffic demands lead to an intense usage of those paths, decreasing the QoS-capabilities of the applications due to packet collisions and congestion. In this paper, we exploit this property to achieve load balancing using a simple packet distribution scheme. The general idea is that spreading data traffic over multiple suboptimal routing paths will lead to a better overall network performance
Routing is a fundamental part of network protocols, i.e., a set of well-defined rules and data formats that allow nodes in a network to communicate with each other. However, routing in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) is still a very active area of research, as it is NP-hard and prone to unpredictable meeting patterns and frequent disconnections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve this problem in DTNs, a class of delay-tolerant networks that lack continuous connectivity due to their mobility and energy resources.
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising architecture for creating scalable and efficient IoT networks. However, no holistic NDN of Things (NDNoT) architecture and protocol suite has yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose a scalable and secure framework for onboarding and routing in the NDNoT. We combine our approaches to authentication and onboarding into a single holistic framework for Lightweight Authentication & Secured Routing (LASeR). The combined authentication and onboarding processes are very lightweight, requiring only three round trips and few cryptographic operations.
Mobile robotic networks are an important subset of mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) and form a class for a wide range of different network types. The provision of reliable end-to-end communication in this kind of networks is a challenging topic due to the high relative mobility. Existing routing protocols can barely cope with the frequently changing network and fail to adopt to the new channel and topology conditions. In this paper, we combine these approaches to enhance the overall routing performance and the stability of communication paths in low altitude UA V networks. Application layer mobility control data is used to predict future no
RPL is a distance based proactive routing protocol used for routing in Low Power Lossy Networks (LLN). In IoT, every node maintains its rank relative to its position in the Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG). The DODAG is maintained by control and route information. The control frames used by RPL are DODAG Information Object (DIO), Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) and DODAG Information Solicitation (DIO) and routing metrics, route constraints and objective functions (O
Routing protocols are designed to calculate paths for communication networks. In proactive protocols, periodic exchange of messages and maintains routing tables. In reactive protocols, a route is discovered only when demand arrives. Our simulation work based upon three protocols comparison in MANETs and in VANETs named as AODV, DSR and FSR. Moreover, we introduce some modifications in their routing exchange intervals; 1) in MOD AODV, augments AODV’s Expanding Ring Search algorithm (ERS) limits, 2) in MOD DSR,
In Wireless Sensor Networks, delivery of certain time critical events to the Sink or Base Station within a specific deadline is considered to be one of the important parameters like the other QoS parameters such as reliability, energy, data accuracy, coverage etc. in Wireless Sensor Networks. In this paper we propose a delay aware routing protocol for wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is a routing solution for the transmission of time critical event information to the Sink or Base Station within a deadline. It also ensures reliability by following multipath routing so that at least one copy of the event information
Circuit routing is a challenging problem that requires a general end-to-end approach that does not depend on domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based approach that embeds the routing state in a deep neural network (DNN). The MCTS-based approach is based on a policy network that embeds the routing state in a graph. The policy network is a deep neural network that embeds the routing state in a graph. The policy network is a network that embeds the routing state. The network embeds the
We study a caching network, i.e., a network of nodes augmented with additional storage capabilities. In such a network, some nodes act as designated content servers, permanently storing content and serving as caches of last resort'. Other nodes generate requests for content that are forwarded towards these designated servers. If, however, an intermediate node in the path towards a server stores the requested content, the request is satisfied early: i.e., the request ceases to be forwarded towards the nearest designated server.
Temporal dynamics are key to the security of anonymity protocols, such as onion routing, and are often abstracted away for simplicity of security analysis. However, for simplicity, designers of anonymity systems often assume that each user communicates with a fixed desti nation once, that the set of participants in the protocol is static, or that the network structure is static. In this paper, we present Temporary Dynamics: a set of attacks that demonstrate the impact of temporal dynamics on the security of several popular anonymity protocols. We target Tor and some of the latest proposals for improving onion routing dynamic
BorderGatewayProtocol (BGP) is a Path Vector Routing protocol, in which routers repeatedly advertise 'better' routes (along with their exisiting routes) to their immediate neighbors. The 'textbook' variant of BGP has many security vulnerabilities. In real implementations, a modified variant of BGP called SecureBGP (SB GP) is used. In this paper, we propose a protocol for wireless routing, based on a novel signature scheme called Chain Signatures (CS). We extend the work of [5
Qrouting is a class of adaptive routing policies which use the learning framework of reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the routing problem in network onchip (NoC) architectures.

The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a family of proposals that semantically decouple identity from location, currently overloaded by IP addresses, by creating two separate names paces that unambiguously address endhosts (identi ers) and their Internet attachment points (locators). This new indirection level has the advantage that it allows the implementation of complex trace engineering mechanisms but at the same time enables the locator space to remain quasistatic and highly aggregatable. However, it also pushes the LISP edge cache model that scales O(1) with respect to
Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has been proposed to facilitate high data rate transmissions among near users, offering higher throughput, efficient spectral usage, extended network coverage and improved energy efficiency. In recent years, D2D has been considered as one of the key enabling technologies in 5G cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for opportunistic cost-effective forwarding in D2D networks, based on the Bubble Rap strategy. The most successful strategy relies on two aspects: information about the node popularity of the
Deep learning (DL) models have become increasingly prevalent, and there is a growing need for understanding DL predictions in many decision-making areas. However, understanding the contribution of different input parts to explain the prediction is usually not sufficiently informative for decision-making: people often want to know what changes made to the input could have led to a specific target prediction. In this paper, we propose an ideal method to provide actionable counterfactual explanations on how to modify the input to achieve a counterfactual (target) output. In practice, we call such
Wire lessHART is a real-time wireless sensor network that is used in industrial process control systems. The WirelessHART network is a TDMA based wireless sensor network that is best suited for industrial process control systems. The WirelessHART network is pre-determined by the centralized network manager at the time of network initialization. The schedule in a WirelessHART network is repeated over every hyperperiod. The repetition greatly helps the attacker to analyze the eavesdropped traces and infer the schedule. The

Eco routing based on traffic information and predicted fuel consumption can reduce fuel consumption and travel time. However, the potential of eco routing has not been deeply explored. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric data driven fuel consumption model based on real world driving data and Autonomie fuel consumption simulation model. The model is based on Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and a constrained eco routing strategy addressing tradeoff between fuel consumption and travel time. The model is invariant under any coordinate system, thus it is invariant under any
In this paper, we consider the reroute package pickup and delivery planning of the shipper. In the reroute scenario, the customers can request for package pickup and delivery anytime. The shipper first decides whether to accept or reject the requests given available trucks. If the request is accepted, the shipper has to decide how to utilize and reroute the trucks that might be already serving other customers to accommodate the new request. If the request is rejected, the shipper will outsource the delivery to a third-party carrier which typic
Free space optics (FSO) is a technique for transmitting data via the atmosphere. It is a promising technique for multimedia sensor networks. However, FSO networks have several limitations. These include the requirement that a direct line of sight path exists between a sender and a receiver. However, FSO networks offer several unique advantages over RF networks. These include the fact that FSO avoids interference with existing RF communications infrastructure, is cheaply deployed since there is no government licensing of scarce spectrum required, is not susceptible to “jamming” attacks, and
MANET is a wireless network without a central administration. Its open design makes it vulnerable to attacks. Attacks are any activity or threat that compromises a network's security. MANET's open design makes it vulnerable to attacks. This paper presents a blockchain based, management secure, QoS enhanced MANET. SRA with blockchain enables network security by producing hash codes for each transaction and authenticating each node that joins the network. Without verification, nodes distrust each other. Without verification, node
Maximum Profit pickup Routing Problem (MPRP) is a generalization of the strongly NPhard Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), making MPRP, MPRPM, and MPRPMVS also strongly NPhard by extension. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for MPRP, which works under certain assumptions about the problem input parameters such as time windows and spatial distribution of the input sites around the depot. The algorithm is based on the randomized entropy of the entropy of the depot

Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) are wireless networks that allow vehicles to communicate with each other without any pre-deployed infrastructure. The main challenge in VANETs is providing a reliable and efficient routing in urban scenarios with regard to the challenges (i.e., high vehicle mobility and presence of radio obstacle). In this paper, a position-based routing protocol is proposed for VANETs that uses the learning algorithm for decreasing the communication overhead and the number of hops. Furthermore, this protocol uses the traffic information for improving learning. The proposed
This paper provides a complete and accurate formal specification of the core functionality of the Ad hoc OnDemand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol using the specification language AWN. AWN provides the right level of abstraction to model key features such as unicast and broadcast, while abstracting from implementation details.Asitssemanticsiscompletelyunambiguous, specifying a protocol in AWN enforces to tal precision and the removal of any ambiguities.A key contribution is to demonstrate how AWN can be used to provide rigorous proofs of key properties of the AODV
The IP traffic matrix is a key parameter in network operation and management. It is a mathematical relation of the three parameters link load, routing, and traffic matrix, which is easily available from all network nodes via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests and is typically monitored by network operators. The estimation of the traffic matrix based on these statistics is a difficult problem, as the required SDN byte counters may not be sufficiently implemented (or even not at all), or the deployed SDN nodes may be too few, or not adequately located in the network. We propose to augment the required
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly emerging as an important and influential factor in mobile computing, wireless systems, and vehicular ad hoc networks. The main purpose of WSNs is to monitor, analyze, combine and respond to the data which are gathered by hundreds or thousands of sensors which are distributed in a sensing field. In this paper, (ECQSR) protocol proposes; Efficient Energy, Cost Reduction, and QoS based routing protocol for WSNs, to achieve load balancing by splitting the data traffic among sensor nodes, in the

We have selected two reactive routing protocols i.e. AODV and DSR and one position based routing protocol i.e. GPSR for simulation purpose analysis. We have analysed
Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols provide a way for two parties, a sender, Alice, and a receiver, Bob, to share an unconditionally secure key in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. The best-known QKD protocols are the Bennett Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol and the six-state protocol. The unconditional security of the BB84 protocol has been proved, and the security of the six-state protocol has been proved. In this paper, we study the key rates of QKD protocols that use the entanglement distillation
The need for interdomain quality of service (QoS) is becoming more urgent than ever. The need for interdomain QoS is driven by emerging applications (e.g., metaverse, live 3Dvideo for sports and entertainment events, remote interactive operations, etc.). The need for interdomain QoS is becoming more urgent than ever. The need for interdomain QoS is becoming more urgent than ever. The problem is that the service providers are invisible from the end host’s perspective and thus they cannot be held accountable
Geographic routing protocols are fast becoming a popular choice for wireless adhoc and sensor networks. In such networks, the final destination nodes may be located in a specific geographic region. To maintain uninterrupted service in such a scenario, the participating nodes in the network need to have a sound reserve of residual energy. One way to reduce the energy consumption of the network is to reduce the frequency of packet transmission with out compromising the reliability. This can be done by waiting for a considerable number of packets to a particular destination to arrive first. But this approach is sure to reduce the number of hops
Multihop wireless networks are a promising technology for delivering messages and data from sources to destinations. However, routing protocols that use less information possible and need minimal energy consumption of nodes have become more than valuable in this context. In this paper, we study the impact of shortest path routing on a large multihop wireless network. We show that, when using geographic routing, 25% of the messages are relayed by the nodes deployed in a small central congested region whose area is 3% of the total area of the square.
Offchain networks (or payment channel networks) are emerging as promising solutions to scale blockchain. They allow two participants to make multiple payments with each other, without the need to commit every transaction to the blockchain. However, the blockchain is only involved when the participants on the payment channel achieve an agreement with a multisignature contract such as a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC). As a result, offchain networks have the potential to significantly improve the transaction throughput and reduce the transaction latency of blockchain. However, routing is critical for offchain networks, as the channel balance changes after every payment in the channel.
Mobile ad hoc networks are networks that do not require the usage of wires or cables for communication. Due to the limited transmission range of wireless network interfaces, multiple networks “hops” may be needed for one node to exchange data with another across the network. The routing protocol used in these networks is called Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). DSR is an on-demand routing protocol and cannot perform well in a large MANET. The reason is that it has scalability issues when the size of the network increases. DSR is an on-demand routing protocol
We propose a routing protocol that can handle the complexity of sparse network connectivity. We consider the case of a low-density network, where the network density is only slightly above 0, and the topology of the network is qualitatively dissimilar from networks of high densities (e.g., =5). We then consider the case of a foam-like network, where the topology of the network is qualitatively dissimilar from that of a fog-like network. We then consider the network density of the critical density, 0,
